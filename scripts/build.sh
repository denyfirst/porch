# the version and Go's own mechanism fetches it. Installing one elsewhere
# gives a different GOROOT, which -trimpath does not reach.

#
# -X main.version stamps the tag into the binary. Without it a program could
# not say which release it was: -buildvcs=false is deliberate, and the tag in
# the filename is lost the moment somebody renames or packages the file, so an
# operator holding a binary had no way to check whether it was the one that
# fixed anything. The value comes from the tag argument, which both callers
# pass identically, so two builds of one tag still produce identical bytes and
# a reproduction still compares like with like.
#
# Together they make the output depend on the source, the compiler and the tag
# and nothing else. Any flag added here has to be added for both callers at
# once, which is now automatic.

# that was released — signed, listed in SHA256SUMS, and rebuilt by the

# reproduction produces the same bytes: .gitattributes gives every checkout
# LF line endings, Windows included.
