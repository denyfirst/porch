.SYNOPSIS
    Signs a release that was built in public, and publishes it.

.DESCRIPTION
    The binaries are not built here. A workflow builds them from the tagged
    source on a machine nobody controls, in a log anyone can read, and this
    downloads that result, checks it, signs the checksums and publishes.

    The reason is the one that matters most about a release. A signature says
    the artifacts came from whoever holds the key; it says nothing about
    whether they correspond to the source. Building on the same machine that
    signs means one compromise produces both a malicious binary and a valid
    signature for it, and nothing in the chain notices.

    Splitting it means two separate parties are involved: a workflow that
    builds but cannot sign, and this machine, which signs but does not build.
    Compromising either alone yields nothing, and the build is visible to
    everyone while it happens.

    Optionally rebuilds locally and compares. It is off by default because it
    needs bash and a checkout of the tag, not because of the platform: the
    claim that it only held on Linux was tested on 2026-08-23 and is wrong.
    See -Compare.

.PARAMETER Tag
    The version being released, such as v0.1.0.

.PARAMETER SigningKey
    Path to the private key used for the signature. Separate from the GitHub
    key on purpose: one being lost must not cost the other.

.PARAMETER Compare
    Rebuild locally and compare against what the workflow produced.

    This used to say the comparison only meant something on Linux, because a
    cross-compile from Windows puts a different GOROOT into the runtime
    package and -trimpath does not reach it. Measured on 2026-08-23, from
    Windows, against v0.3.0: ten artifacts, ten identical. The reason is in
    the release's own BUILD record — the toolchain came from the module cache
    rather than from an installed GOROOT, and -trimpath does normalise module
    cache paths.

    So it holds wherever the toolchain is the fetched one, which is whenever
    the go directive in go.mod names a version other than the Go on PATH. When
    they are the same version, the build uses the installed GOROOT and the
    bytes will differ by that path. BUILD records the goroot for exactly this
    comparison; check it before concluding anything from a mismatch.

    Runs scripts/build.sh — the one the release's BUILD record names — so it
    needs bash. Found on PATH, or in the usual Git for Windows locations, which
    is where it actually lives: the installer adds cmd\ to PATH but not bin\.

.EXAMPLE
    powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\release.ps1 -Tag v0.2.0

    On a default Windows installation PowerShell refuses to run any script
    file, so `.\scripts\release.ps1` fails before this script starts. The
    child process above is allowed to and changes nothing outside itself.

    This example used to be the bare path, which is an instruction that does
    not work on the one kind of machine it is written for. Do not relax the
    machine's policy instead: the execution policy is not a security boundary
    -- -ExecutionPolicy Bypass is a documented flag, not a trick -- so making
    it permanent buys no safety and loses the accident it does prevent. What
    protects this step is that the script is in this repository and has been
    read.

.EXAMPLE
    powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\release.ps1 -Tag v0.2.0 -Compare

    -Compare needs the tag checked out. It rebuilds from the tag's own build
    script, and against a different working tree it reports a difference count
    for the wrong source.

.NOTES
    The whole procedure, including the dry run that has to happen before a
    first release and after any change to this script, is docs/releasing.md.
