// Command porch-scan inspects a server's TLS configuration and
// certificate chain from the command line.
//
// It exists to exercise the whole pipeline against real servers. The library
// packages are tested against certificates generated in memory, which proves
// the logic but not the plumbing; this proves the plumbing.
//
// Usage:
//
//	porch-scan example.com
//	porch-scan example.com:8443 another.example
//	porch-scan -json example.com
//	porch-scan -allow-private 10.0.0.5
//	porch-scan 93.184.216.34
//
// Exit status is the worst verdict found, so the command can gate a pipeline:
// 0 when everything measured was strong, 1 on a weak finding, 2 on an insecure
// one, 3 when the scan itself could not be completed, and 4 when a scan
// finished but graded nothing.
//
// The fourth code is the one worth explaining. A verdict of ungraded is not a
// pass: it means no measurement survived to be graded, and the commonest way
// to reach it is a host that answers a handshake or two and then goes quiet,
// which is something the scanned host chooses. Folding that into 0 would let
// the party being gated turn the gate off, so it has a code of its own.
