// host_port — the port comes from the scan, which fills in the default — while
// -history passed its argument through untouched and looked for the bare host.
// Everything worked for the web and mail checks, which have no port, so the
// defect was invisible until somebody read a TLS history back. Found by running
// it rather than by any test, which is why the test below asserts that the two
// agree rather than asserting two literals.
//
// Host and port are kept apart rather than the port dropped: scanning one host
// on two ports is two different measurements — the service's own per-target
// budget says so in the same words — and folding them into one history would
// interleave two servers' verdicts under one name. A colon is not a filename
// character on every platform this ships to, so the separator is not one.

// them a default one would file a history under a port nothing measured.
