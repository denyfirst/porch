// Package smtptls asks a domain's mail exchangers whether they accept an
// encrypted connection, and what certificate they present when they do.
//
// # What is said, and nothing more
//
// One SMTP conversation per exchanger, on port 25, in the order RFC 5321 and
// RFC 3207 give it: read the greeting, send EHLO, read what the server offers,
// send STARTTLS if it offers it, negotiate TLS, send QUIT. That is the whole of
// it.
//
// No message is ever composed or sent. There is no DATA, so nothing is
// delivered, nothing is queued and nothing at the other end changes. What an
// exchanger's log records is a client that said hello, asked for encryption,
// and left — which is what every sending server that finds nothing to deliver
// looks like.
//
// # The one question that names anybody
//
// A caller may ask whether the exchanger forwards mail for a domain it does not
// serve: the question that finds an open relay, which is a server spammers use
// as their own until it is listed everywhere. Asking it takes an empty reverse
// path — the one every bounce carries, naming nobody — and a recipient under
// .invalid, which RFC 2606 reserves so that it cannot exist. Then RSET, before
// DATA, so the transaction is abandoned and a server that said yes was never
// given anything to forward.
//
// That question is off unless a caller turns it on, and internal/mailscan turns
// it on for an exchanger inside the domain being checked and for no other. An
// exchanger belonging to a provider is somebody else's server: in their logs the
// conversation reads as a spam probe, and the address it came from is the one
// that gets listed for it.
//
// # The name it gives
//
// EHLO carries a name, and RFC 5321 says it is the client's own: its fully
// qualified host name, or where it has none, its address in brackets. That is
// what is sent. A name the operator configures comes first; then this machine's
// host name, if it is fully qualified; then its address as a literal. Nothing is
// invented to hide who is asking — on a deployment somebody runs to check their
// own mail there is nothing to hide, and a name that does not exist is one a
// correctly configured server may refuse, which would be reported as a server
// that could not be measured.
//
// # What is read
//
// Replies are bounded before they are believed: a line is at most the thousand
// bytes RFC 5321 allows, and a reply at most sixty-four lines. The certificate
// is taken from the handshake and judged against the deployment's own trust
// store, the same store that decides the word "trusted" for the other checks
// (R7).
