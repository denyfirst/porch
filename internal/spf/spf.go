// Package spf reads a domain's sender policy and counts what it costs to
// evaluate.
//
// SPF says which servers may send mail claiming to be from a domain. Reading
// the record is easy and is not the useful part: almost every domain has one,
// and the failures that matter are the ones a domain owner cannot see by
// looking at it.
//
// # The ten lookup limit is the finding
//
// RFC 7208 allows at most ten DNS-resolving terms in the evaluation of one
// policy — include, a, mx, ptr, exists, and the redirect modifier — counted
// across everything the record pulls in, not just its own line. A record that
// exceeds it is a permanent error, and a receiver treating a permerror the way
// most do will act as though the domain published **no policy at all**.
//
// That is the shape of the problem worth building a check around. The record
// looks fine. The provider that was added last year looks fine. Nothing in the
// zone file says anything is wrong, and mail that should have been rejected is
// being accepted, or mail that should have been accepted is being marked as
// spam — depending on which side of the limit the receiver falls. The only way
// to see it is to follow every include the way a receiver would and count.
//
// # Nothing is connected to on the mail path
//
// Every term here is resolved with a DNS query and nothing else. No connection
// is made to a mail server, no message is composed, nothing is sent, and
// nothing that would change state at the other end is attempted. The strongest
// privacy story any check in this project has, and it is a property of what SPF
// is rather than a restraint applied to it.
//
// # Counting, not deciding
//
// This does not evaluate a policy against a sending address. Evaluation needs
// an address, a HELO name and a sender to judge, and answering "would this
// message pass" for a message nobody sent is a question about nothing. What is
// counted is what a receiver would have to do, which is the part that can be
// wrong before any message exists.
