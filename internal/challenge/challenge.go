// Package challenge fetches the file half of a verification challenge.
//
// It is one request for a file an operator deliberately placed, made before a
// host is scanned and only when the DNS proof was not found. It is not a
// check: nothing it reads becomes a measurement, nothing it returns reaches a
// report, and if the file is absent the host is refused rather than described.
//
// It lives here rather than in internal/verify because that package decides
// who may be scanned and imports nothing of this project's own — the same
// property internal/policy has, and for the same reason: a rule about who may
// be reached should be readable without reading an HTTP client.
//
// # The connection is the dangerous part
//
// A fetch is a connection this deployment opens to a host somebody named, and
// it happens before the boundary has decided anything. That is the shape of an
// SSRF into the scanner, which is one of the three things verification exists
// to survive. So it dials through safedial exactly as a scan does, refuses
// every port but the secure one, follows nothing, and reads a bounded body.
