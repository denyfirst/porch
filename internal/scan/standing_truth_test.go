// A standing limit describes what this build actually does.
//
// It is the strongest sentence in a report: findings are about one server, and
// a standing limit says what is true of every scan this program runs. So a
// stale one is the worst kind of wrong — it is wrong about us, on every report,
// and a reader has no way to check it.
//
// One went stale and shipped. "No certificate authority is ever asked ...
// revocation is read only from a response the server stapled into the
// handshake, so where none was stapled it has not been established here by any
// means" stayed word for word while an ordinary build started fetching the
// authority's revocation list — so a single report said the list had been
// fetched and verified, two inches above a limit saying nothing had been asked
// of anybody.
//
// This test lives here rather than in internal/policy because this is the
// package that does the fetching. The limit is written where the rules are; the
// behaviour it describes is here, and only something that can see both can tell
// whether they agree.
