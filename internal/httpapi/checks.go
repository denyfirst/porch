// A check is one thing this service can be asked to measure.

// Of the eighteen steps between a request arriving and a report being written,
// twelve are identical for every check: the client key, the read allowance,
// the cross-site test, the content type, the scan allowance, the body cap, the
// JSON decode, the exclusion list, the deployment list, the deadline, the
// concurrency cap and the per-target budget. A second handler would copy all
// twelve, and N6 is written about exactly that — a guard in one place is a
// guard somebody walks around by adding an entry point, and adding entry
// points is what this project is now doing.
//
// So the differences are described here and the chain is written once.
