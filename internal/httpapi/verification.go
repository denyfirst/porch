// The verification endpoint: what a domain has to publish for this deployment
// to scan it, and whether it has.
//
// Until this existed the token was printed by porchd -verification-token on the
// operator's machine, so the person at the page was told to publish a record
// only the operator could look up. The page now asks, shows the record, and
// asks again once it is published.
//
// Handing out a token is safe, and the reason is the design of the token
// rather than anything here. It is derived from this deployment's secret and
// the one domain, so it is worth something only to whoever can publish it in
// that domain's zone — which is the thing being proven. Copying it to another
// domain proves nothing, because that domain's token is a different value, and
// another deployment's token for the same domain is a different value again,
// because its secret is. Knowing the token is not the proof; publishing it is.

// verifyRecord is one place a proof can be published.
