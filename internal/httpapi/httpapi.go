// Package httpapi serves the scanner over HTTP.
//
// The command line tool takes its input from the operator. This package takes
// it from strangers, and that difference is the whole design.
//
// Seven limits apply. Six are per request: how large the body may be, how long
// the work may take, how often one client may ask for a scan, how often one
// client may ask for anything at all, how many scans may run at once, and how
// often any one host may be scanned. The seventh is per connection, in
// LimitListener, because a TLS handshake costs real work before any request
// exists to limit.
//
// The fourth of those reads oddly beside the third, so it is worth a line. A
// request turned away before it reaches the scan allowance is cheap, but it is
// not free: it takes the counter lock, and it moves a figure this service
// publishes. An unlimited refusal path is therefore both a way to spend this
// machine's processor and a way to write into the only numbers an operator has
// to watch. A read allowance, kept apart from the scan one, closes that
// without letting a cross-site request spend the visitor's scan budget on
// their behalf. /healthz and /api/v1/stats draw on that same allowance, for
// the same reason: they do no scanning and should never be free to call in a
// loop. Asking whether a domain is proven draws on an allowance and slots of
// its own in place of the scan ones, so that opening the Domains page, which
// asks once per domain, never spends what a scan needs.
//
// All but one protect this service. The per-host limit protects the server
// being measured, which had no say in whether it is measured at all.
//
// Every refusal is counted by reason. An operator running a public service
// has to be able to see a change in the shape of what arrives, and asking
// users to trust somebody who is not watching would be its own kind of
// carelessness. The counts name reasons rather than requesters, so they can
// be published without describing anybody.
//
// There is no equivalent of the command line switches. The scanner reaches
// the network through safedial, which refuses private, loopback, link-local
// and reserved destinations; it dials only implicit-TLS ports; and it takes
// hostnames rather than addresses. None of that is configurable here. A
// public endpoint that dials arbitrary addresses is an open proxy into
// whatever network it runs in.
//
// Nothing about a request is logged: not the target, not the client address,
// not the result. The addresses held for rate limiting live in memory and are
// swept as they go idle. This is the claim the project is built on, so it is
// enforced by there being no code that could write it down.
