// own. Everything here is the translation between them, and the translation
// is where the interesting mistakes are.
//
// The one that matters most is which response's policy counts. A browser
// applies Strict-Transport-Security from every response it receives over a
// secure transport and ignores it on every response that arrives any other
// way, so a chain of three redirects has three chances to set a policy and
// one of them may be the only one that does. Reading the header off the last
