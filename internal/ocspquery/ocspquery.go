// Package ocspquery asks a certificate's own responder whether it has been
// revoked, and believes the answer only once it verifies.
//
// # Why this is separate
//
// internal/ocsp reads a response the server stapled, and nothing there fetches
// anything. Asking the responder directly carries the certificate's serial and
// its issuer, so the authority that issued it learns that somebody — from this
// address, at this moment — looked at it.
//
// That is asking the source: the authority holds the answer and nobody else
// does. Every deployment asks it, and only about a certificate for a name the
// scan may reach — a proven domain, or the demonstration's own. Until
// 2026-10-10 it waited for a flag on the command line, and a revoked
// certificate on a service was reported as unknown. See R3a.
//
// # What is guarded
//
// The address comes from the certificate the scanned server sent, so it is
// chosen by the party being measured — the argument N11 makes for revocation
// lists, and the same guards follow: safedial, ports 80 and 443, http and https
// only, credentials stripped, no redirect, no proxy, two responders at most, and
// a size cap that refuses rather than truncates. What comes back is believed
// only after internal/ocsp verifies it against the issuer and finds it current.
