//
// Go checks a certificate's dates before it looks for an issuer, so Expired is
// the error it returns for an expired certificate whether or not anything
// would ever have vouched for it. Reading that error as "trusted apart from
// the dates" was true for a real certificate past its renewal date and false
// for every self-signed or private-CA certificate that had gone stale — and
// those are the ones a scan of an abandoned service actually finds.
//
// Three things went wrong at once, which is why this is asserted rather than
// left to the expiry test: the trusted flag itself, the suppression of
// cert.chain-untrusted, and a transparency note that turns round and tells a
// private certificate that browsers refuse it for not being logged.
