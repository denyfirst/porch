// Package certinfo describes the certificate chain a server presented and
// grades it against the rules in package policy.
//
// Nothing here touches the network. The chain arrives as a slice of parsed
// certificates, and everything else is computation, so the whole package is
// testable against certificates generated in memory.
//
// The split from tlsprobe is the same one that separates measurement from
// judgement elsewhere in this project: tlsprobe collects, certinfo describes,
// policy decides.
//
// # The chain is untrusted input
//
// Every other limit in this project bounds what arrives in a request. These
// bound what arrives in a reply, which is a different direction and easy to
// forget: the scanner connects to a server chosen by whoever asked, and that
// server decides what to send back.
//
// A certificate may carry a subject thousands of characters long, hundreds of
// alternative names, and a chain of dozens. Go parses all of it. Passing it
// through unbounded would turn one small request into a response measured in
// megabytes, which the person who asked for the scan pays for, not the server
// that sent it.
//
// Anything cut is stated in the report. A truncated list presented as a
// complete one would be the same failure this project criticises elsewhere.
