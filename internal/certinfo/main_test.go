// A root this package's tests can actually reach.
//
// Every chain these tests built used to fail verification, because a root
// generated in a test is not in the machine's store. Nothing was wrong with
// that until it started hiding things: every report came out `insecure` from
// cert.chain-untrusted whatever else was true, so a rule that only shows up on
// an otherwise sound chain could not be seen at all. The chain verdict landed
// in that blind spot on 2026-09-02 — the fold over the issuers could be
// deleted and no test noticed, because the leaf was already insecure.
//
// One root, built here and handed to every Analyse call as its Roots. It used
// to be installed through SSL_CERT_FILE instead, which worked on Linux and on
// nothing else: only Go's unix root loader reads that variable, so on Windows
// and macOS the PEM was written and never consulted, and two tests failed there
// from the day they were written. Passing the pool is what the program does
// now, so the tests take the same path it does.
//
// The store holds exactly one certificate, and no public authority. Nothing
// here should ever depend on a real root, and a test that started to would
// now fail rather than pass for a reason nobody chose.
