// consults a different store and reads neither SSL_CERT_FILE nor anything this
// program checked when it started. porchd satisfied itself at startup that
// its trust store was not empty and then judged every chain against something
// else, on the two platforms self-hosting is most likely to run on.

// the exact path this change closes.

// runs on, and a test that skips itself everywhere says nothing at all.
