// Two moduli built the way RSALib built them.

// Not borrowed from a corpus and not a vector copied out of a paper: each is
// the product of two primes of the form k·M + (65537^a mod M), constructed by
// the test below and frozen here so that the detector is exercised on every
// run without spending the time to search for primes again.
//
// The first is the 512-bit case, where M is the product of the first 39
// primes, and it is 511 bits — one short of the key size, which is why the
// size guard sits well below 512. The second is the 1024-bit case, with the
// first 71 primes.
