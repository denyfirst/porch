// Package mailscan reads what a domain publishes about its mail and grades it.
//
// Almost everything here comes out of a DNS lookup: the sender policy and what
// it costs a receiver to evaluate, the DMARC instruction, whether the domain
// asks for reports when transport security fails, which hosts accept its mail,
// and what those hosts publish about protecting it in transit. No message is
// composed or sent, and nothing that would change state at the other end is
// attempted. That is a property of what these
// records are rather than a restraint applied to them: the queries go to the
// resolver this machine already asks about every target, and the domain being
// examined learns nothing at all.
//
// # The one exception, and what it is fenced with
//
// An MTA-STS policy is announced in DNS and served as a file over HTTPS. The
// record says a policy exists; only the file says what it is, and the difference
// between a policy in testing mode and one in enforce mode is the difference
// between measuring the problem and preventing it. For the whole life of this
// check a report could say a policy was announced and nothing more, and an
// operator who left a rollout in testing mode two years ago had the appearance
// of protection and none of it.
//
// So the policy is fetched, under four conditions, and ReadSTSPolicy is off
// until a caller says otherwise:
//
//   - **Only where the domain announces one.** No record, no request. The
//     record is the zone saying *there is a policy at that address*, which is
//     what makes reading it an instruction being followed rather than an
//     address being tried (N7).
//   - **Only where control of the domain has been proven.** The same condition
//     the web check reads a page under, and the same reason: the request goes to
//     a host in an estate the person asking has shown is theirs.
//   - **One address, fixed by RFC 8461.** No path is constructed, no redirect
//     is followed, and the certificate must verify.
//   - **Not a mail server.** mta-sts.<domain> on port 443 is a web host, and
//     nothing is sent to it but one GET.
//
// See internal/mtasts, and N13 for the argument.
//
// # The exchangers themselves
//
// Whether an exchanger accepts STARTTLS, and what certificate it presents, is
// asked in one SMTP conversation with each: the greeting, EHLO, STARTTLS, the TLS
// handshake, QUIT. No sender, recipient or message is ever named, so nothing is
// delivered and nothing at the other end changes. ReadExchangers is off until a
// caller sets it — the command line does, and a service does exactly where it
// requires proof of control — and only the exchangers the domain's own MX
// records name are asked, at most maxExchangers of them. See internal/smtptls.
//
// # What is deliberately not here
//
// **Discovering a DKIM selector.** A key lives at <selector>._domainkey.<domain>
// and DNS offers no query for what is beneath a name, so there is no set to
// find. Keys are read under selectors this scan is told to look under — the
// operator's own, and the ones mail providers document for their own service —
// and a report names every selector it tried. "These names hold nothing" is
// never rendered as "this domain publishes no key" (R4). See internal/dkim.
//
// **The MTA-STS policy, where a deployment does not fetch it.** Reading the
// policy is one HTTPS request and runs only behind proof of control, so a
// deployment configured without proof reads the record and stops there. What
// such a report says is that a policy is announced and that what it says was not
// read — never the stronger reading, which is the one a reader supplies for
// themselves if nobody stops them.
//
// **Whether a DANE binding is correct, where no exchanger was contacted.** The
// TLSA records are read either way. Checking that one matches needs the
// certificate the exchanger presents, so it is checked exactly where the
// exchangers are asked for STARTTLS (see readExchangerTLS and internal/dane).

// naming the address itself, so fetching it is following an instruction the
// domain published for every sending server on the internet to follow.
//

// caller sets it, and a caller sets it where control of the domain has been
// proven. The request goes to a host in somebody's estate; the condition is that
// it is the estate of whoever asked.
//
// **A failure is never a finding.** A policy that could not be fetched is
// recorded with its reason and nothing about it is graded, because a fetch
// failing here looks identical to a domain whose policy host is broken and to
// this machine's egress being blocked. The first is theirs to fix and the second
