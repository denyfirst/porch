// Package webprobe reads the response headers a web server sends to an
// ordinary client, over HTTPS and over plaintext HTTP, and records the
// redirects it is told to follow.
//
// It exists because several security properties of a website are visible only
// in an HTTP response and not in a TLS handshake. A host can negotiate TLS 1.3
// with a perfect certificate and still be trivially stripped: no
// Strict-Transport-Security, and port 80 serving content instead of sending
// the visitor to the secure address. The TLS check grades that host strong,
// correctly, and says nothing about the way it is actually reached.
//
// An HTTP request is not a TLS handshake, and the difference is the reason
// this is a separate package with its own rules rather than a few more fields
// on the TLS probe:
//
//   - A handshake stops at the transport. A request enters the application:
//     it appears in an access log with a path, it reaches whatever sits in
//     front of the origin, and on a badly built application a GET can change
//     state.
//
//   - Half the ports this project scans have no HTTP at all — 465, 636, 990,
//     993, 995 and 5061 among them. A header check folded into the TLS scan
//     would report a missing security header for a mail server, which is not
//     a finding but a category error.
//
// So the discipline is written into the code rather than left to the caller:
//
//   - One GET of "/", over HTTPS and over plaintext, and one of
//     /.well-known/security.txt. Nothing else.
//
//   - No path is ever constructed here. After the first request the only
//     addresses fetched are the ones a Location header names. There is no
//     probing of /admin, no /backup.zip, and no second guess of any kind: this
//     reads what the server volunteers to everybody.
//
//     The security.txt fetch is the one address under /.well-known, and it is
//     not a guess: RFC 9116 defines that file as the thing a site publishes so
//     that a stranger who finds a fault knows who to tell. Every address this
//     project asks for under that space is named in internal/wellknown, beside
//     the document defining it. Until 2026-09-24 this paragraph promised no
//     guessing under /.well-known while the mail check had been reading a
//     policy there for months, which is why the promise is now a list a test
//     can check rather than a sentence.
//
//   - The body is read only where a caller asks for it, and nothing of it is
//     kept. Until 2026-09-11 this said "the body is never read", and that
//     sentence is what the change has to be measured against. What is read now
//     is the final HTML response, to a bound, streamed, and only where
//     ReadMarkup is set — never in a demonstration build, where the call is
//     compiled out. What survives is internal/markup.Facts: hosts and
//     booleans. There is no field anywhere on the way out that could hold
//     markup, which is the same arrangement that keeps a cookie's value out of
//     a report.
//
//     The reason for reading it is that mixed content, a form posting in the
//     clear, and a policy declared in a meta tag are ordinary things an
//     organisation has and cannot see from headers. The reason it was refused
//     for so long is that a body holds keys, tokens and names, and a report is
//     a thing people paste into issue trackers — so the rule that replaced the
//     old one is about what may be kept rather than about what may be read.
//
//   - Only headers this check grades are kept. A header outside the list in
//     recorded() is not merely ignored; it is never held, so it cannot reach
//     a report, a log or a JSON payload somebody pastes into a chat window.
//
//   - Cookie values are not recorded, and there is nowhere to put one. Cookie
//     carries the name and the attributes that decide whether a cookie is
//     safe; it has no value field at all, because a field that exists is a
//     field somebody fills in later.
//
//   - The client identifies itself truthfully, and the user agent names a
//     page explaining exactly what is sent. A scan that is recognisable is
//     one an administrator can decide about; an anonymous one is one they can
//     only be alarmed by.
