// Package ctsearch finds the certificates a public log has recorded for a name.
//
// Every publicly trusted certificate is submitted to append-only logs before a
// browser will accept it. That is what makes this possible: a certificate
// somebody obtained for your name, from any authority, is in those logs whether
// or not you know about it. Finding one you did not order is the earliest
// warning available that a name has been issued for behind your back — and it
// is a warning nothing in a handshake can give, because the certificate you are
// looking for is on somebody else's server.
//
// # This asks a third party a question that names you
//
// A log is an append-only structure of billions of entries with no index by
// name, so "which certificates exist for example.com" cannot be asked of a log
// directly. It is asked of a monitor, and the question contains the domain.
//
// That is a larger disclosure than reading a revocation list, where one list
// covers thousands and the question names nothing, and it is the same shape as
// the OCSP query this project refuses. What makes it acceptable is not the
// monitor's reputation — a certificate authority is not automatically a safe
// recipient of query data, and several of them sell monitoring — but that
// certificate transparency is public by design. The certificates for a name are
// already published to anyone who looks. Nothing new about the domain is
// disclosed; what is disclosed is that somebody is looking.
//
// So: never on the demonstration, which promises it queries no log. On a
// deployment that required proof of control, the name belongs to whoever asked
// and there is nothing to hide from themselves. On the command line it is the
// operator's explicit choice, because there the name may be somebody else's.
//
// # The monitor is replaceable
//
// Searcher is an interface and the shipped implementation is one field. A
// monitor that goes away, changes its interface, or that an operator would
// rather not use is a substitution rather than a rewrite — which is the honest
// answer to depending on a service this project does not run.
