// Package dnsclient asks a recursive resolver for record types the standard
// library does not expose.
//
// It exists for one of them. net.Resolver can look up A, AAAA, TXT, MX, NS and
// a few more, and there is no general query. CAA is not among them, so asking
// for CAA means building the message.
//
// That is the whole justification, and it is worth stating because the cost is
// real: everything below parses bytes chosen by whoever answers, which is the
// shape of code this project has found six defects in. What follows is written
// as though the resolver is hostile, because on a plaintext UDP path anyone
// able to answer first is the resolver.
//
// # What this does not do
//
// It does not validate DNSSEC. It reads the AD bit the resolver set and
// reports it, which is a claim about what somebody else did. On a path an
// attacker controls the bit can be flipped like anything else in the message;
// what makes it worth reading at all is that the alternative — running a
// validating resolver here — puts this machine's address in front of every
// nameserver it asks, and that is a change to what a scanned party sees.
//
// It does not cache. A scan asks once and forgets, which is the same promise
// the rest of the service makes.
//
// It does not follow CNAME or DNAME chains. RFC 8659 removed the alias
// handling RFC 6844 had, and the walk up the tree replaces it.
