// Package dkim reads the signing keys a domain publishes, at selectors it is
// told to look under.
//
// # Why a selector has to be named
//
// A DKIM key lives at <selector>._domainkey.<domain>, and DNS offers no way to
// list what is under a name. There is no query for "every selector this domain
// has": the only way to find one is to know it already, or to try names and see
// which answer.
//
// Every other tool tries names, and the reason is that every other tool is a
// web form — a stranger types a domain and there is nobody to ask. That is not
// this tool's position. An installation somebody runs themselves is being run
// by the person who set the records up, and asking them is available here in a
// way it is not to a form.
//
// So selectors come from two places, and the report always says which:
//
//   - **Named by the operator.** Exact, and the only authoritative source.
//   - **Documented by a provider.** Google Workspace documents "google";
//     Microsoft 365 documents "selector1" and "selector2". These are not a
//     list this project invented and then graded people against — each is
//     published by the provider whose service uses it, and each entry here
//     carries the provider it belongs to so a reader can go and check.
//
// The second is a convenience and never a claim. A domain where none of them
// answer has not been shown to lack DKIM; it has been shown that these
// particular names hold nothing, and the report says exactly that (R4).
//
// # Why looking is not the guessing this project refuses
//
// Everywhere else, "no guessing" means no constructing paths on somebody's
// server: no /admin, no probing under /.well-known. That rule is about requests
// that reach the scanned party, appear in their access log, and look like an
// attack.
//
// A DNS lookup reaches the target's zone, not the target. A name that does not
// exist costs a resolver one answer and the domain nothing at all, and a key
// that does exist is published for every receiving mail server on the internet
// to read. The two are different acts and this package does the second.
