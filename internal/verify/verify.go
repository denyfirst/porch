// Package verify decides whether a deployment has been shown control of a
// domain before it will scan it.
//
// It is the sibling of internal/exclusion and internal/demo: the same
// boundary, asked in the same place, from a third source of authority. The
// exclusion list is what this project will not touch, whoever asks. The
// demonstration list is compiled into a binary. This one is established at run
// time, by the operator, about their own estate — and it is the one that makes
// a self-hosted service safe to put on a network.
//
// Without it, a porchd anyone can reach is the arrangement N6 dismantled,
// rebuilt inside somebody's intranet: a colleague types a hostname, a
// compromised CI job types a different one, an SSRF into the scanner types
// whatever it likes, and it is the operator's address in a stranger's logs.
// docs/scope.md is the design and the reasoning; this is the code.
//
// # What proof is
//
// A TXT record at _porch-challenge.<domain> carrying the token this
// deployment expects for that domain. Publishing it requires control of the
// zone, which is the thing being proven.
//
// # The token is per domain
//
// Not one secret published everywhere. A single value readable in public DNS
// would let anyone who looked at one domain's record publish the same string
// on a name they control — including a name pointed at somebody else's
// address — and have this deployment scan it. So the token is derived from a
// deployment secret and the domain together, and reading one tells nobody
// anything about another.
//
// # Nothing is remembered
//
// A verification that is checked once and stored is a standing authorisation
// outliving the relationship it came from: a domain changes hands, a supplier
// contract ends, a subsidiary is sold. Re-reading also means revocation works
// by deleting the record, which is the only revocation an operator will
// actually find. A lookup is one round trip.
