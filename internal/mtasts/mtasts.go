// Package mtasts reads the MTA-STS policy a domain publishes.
//
// The DNS record at _mta-sts.<domain> announces that a policy exists. It does
// not say what the policy is: RFC 8461 puts that in a file served over HTTPS at
// mta-sts.<domain>, and until this package existed a report could say a policy
// was announced and nothing else.
//
// That gap was the whole of the finding. A policy in testing mode tells a
// sending server to carry on delivering when TLS fails and to send a report
// about it — which is a rehearsal, not a protection — and it looks identical
// from DNS to one in enforce mode. An operator who set it to testing during a
// rollout two years ago and forgot has no protection and every appearance of
// it, and nothing they can run tells them so.
//
// # This is a connection, and that is the change
//
// The mail check reads DNS and nothing else, and this breaks that. It is one
// GET of one address RFC 8461 fixes, to a host derived from the target, for a
// file the operator deliberately published so that every sending server on the
// internet would read it. No path is invented: the address is
// https://mta-sts.<domain>/.well-known/mta-sts.txt and there is no other.
//
// It runs where control of the domain has been proven, and nowhere else. That
// is the same condition the web check reads a page under, for the same reason:
// the request is to a host in an estate the person asking has shown is theirs.
//
// # What is kept
//
// The mode, the maximum age, and the exchangers the policy names. Nothing else
// — the file is small and public, and there is still no reason to hold bytes a
// rule does not read.
