// Package crl reads a certificate revocation list and says whether a
// certificate is on it.
//
// It exists because the answer moved. Until the CA/Browser Forum made OCSP
// optional and revocation lists mandatory, a certificate that could be checked
// named a responder and a server could staple the answer — which asks nobody
// anything, because the bytes arrive in the handshake. Authorities have taken
// the option: Let's Encrypt, which issues for a large share of the web, stopped
// publishing OCSP entirely. A certificate from one of them names no responder,
// so nothing can be stapled, so a report that only reads stapled responses has
// nothing to say about revocation for most of the internet.
//
// # What this discloses, and to whom
//
// Fetching a list tells the authority that somebody downloaded a list. It does
// not say which certificate is being examined: one list covers thousands, and
// authorities serve them from content delivery networks to the whole internet.
// That is a materially smaller disclosure than the one the privacy page is
// written about — *enquiring whether a certificate is still valid* is OCSP,
// which names the serial in the question — and the difference is why this is
// worth doing where OCSP was not.
//
// It is still a request this project would not otherwise make, and the
// demonstration deployment promises on its privacy page that it makes none. So
// a demonstration build compiles the call out: demo.Enabled is a constant, so
// the branch that would reach this package is eliminated rather than switched
// off, and the promise stays true there by construction rather than by a
// default somebody could change.
//
// Everywhere else it simply runs. A revoked certificate is as serious a finding
// as this check has, and on a deployment that requires proof of control the
// certificate belongs to whoever asked — there is nothing to hide from
// themselves, and a switch they had to find first would be a gap in a report
// dressed as a choice. See docs/scope.md.
//
// # Everything here is untrusted input, in two directions
//
// The address fetched is named by the certificate the scanned server sent, so
// it is chosen by whoever is being scanned. A distribution point reading
// http://10.0.0.1/ is a request into the network this scanner runs in, which is
// why the dialler is the same one every other outbound connection uses and why
// the ports are the two a list is ever published on.
//
// The bytes that come back are chosen by whoever answered that address. They
// are parsed under a size cap and then verified against the issuing
// certificate before a single field is believed — without that, anyone able to
// answer a plaintext HTTP request could report a sound certificate as revoked,
// or a revoked one as sound.
