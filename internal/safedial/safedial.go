// Package safedial provides a dialer that refuses to open connections to
// private, loopback, link-local, or otherwise non-public IP addresses.
//
// It exists because denyfirst runs user-supplied hostnames through
// server-side network probes. Without this guard a visitor could aim the
// scanner at 127.0.0.1, at an RFC 1918 range, or at the cloud metadata
// endpoint (169.254.169.254) and use the service as an SSRF proxy into our
// own infrastructure.
//
// Four properties matter and are each easy to get wrong:
//
//   - The hostname is resolved exactly once. The resolved IP is inspected and
//     then dialled directly. A dialer that resolves for the check and lets the
//     OS resolve again for the connection is open to DNS rebinding: the
//     attacker returns a public address for the first lookup and a private one
//     for the second.
//
//   - Addresses are unmapped before inspection. ::ffff:127.0.0.1 is an IPv6
//     address that is really loopback; without Unmap it passes every check.
//
//   - The number of addresses tried is capped. A hostname served by an
//     attacker-controlled nameserver can resolve to hundreds of addresses.
//     Without a cap, one request turns into hundreds of connection attempts.
//
//   - The whole operation shares one time budget. A per-attempt timeout alone
//     multiplies: eight addresses at ten seconds each is eighty seconds of
//     work for a single request.

// blockedPrefixes covers ranges that netip.Addr has no predicate for.
// Loopback, private (RFC 1918 and RFC 4193 ULA), link-local, multicast and
// unspecified are handled by the predicates in checkAddr.
//
// The IPv6 entries that embed an IPv4 address are the ones that matter, and
// they are the ones easiest to leave out. A predicate such as IsLoopback
// answers for the address it is given, not for the address hidden inside it:
// ::127.0.0.1 is an IPv4-compatible IPv6 address whose low thirty-two bits
// are loopback, and every predicate in checkAddr says it is an ordinary
// global address. Unmap does not help either — it rewrites ::ffff:a.b.c.d and
// nothing else. Each family of embedded address therefore needs its own line
// here, and 2001::/23 covers several at once because IANA reserved that block
// for exactly this kind of protocol assignment.
//
// This is a deny list, which is the shape this file argues against elsewhere.
// The honest reason is that the standard library offers no predicate for "in
// a range IANA has delegated to somebody", so an allow list would mean
// carrying a copy of the delegation registry and keeping it current. The
// exchange is stated rather than hidden: a range added to the special-purpose
// registry after this line was written is not covered until somebody adds it,
// and security-watch.yml exists partly to make that a thing somebody looks at.
