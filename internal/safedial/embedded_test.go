// An IPv6 address can carry an IPv4 address inside it, and every predicate in

// ::ffff:127.0.0.1 is the well-known case and Unmap deals with it. The others
// are not mapped, so Unmap leaves them alone: IsLoopback, IsPrivate and
// IsLinkLocalUnicast all return false for ::127.0.0.1, and without a prefix
// covering the range it reaches the dialler as an ordinary global address.
//
// These are the addresses somebody reaches for after the obvious form is
// refused, which is why they are tested by name rather than left to the
// general shape of the list.
