// Package markup reads a page's HTML and keeps none of it.
//
// This is the first thing in this project that reads a response body, and the
// reason it took this long is written in docs/scope.md: a body holds things a
// report must never carry — a key in a comment, a token in a script, a name in
// a template — and a report is a thing people paste into issue trackers. So the
// shape here is the one that argument allows and no more.
//
//   - **Nothing is stored.** Facts has nowhere to put markup, in the way
//     webprobe.Cookie has nowhere to put a cookie's value. What survives a call
//     is "a script was referenced over plaintext, at this host", never the
//     element that said so.
//
//   - **Hosts, never addresses.** A reference is reduced to its host before it
//     is kept. No path, no query, and no userinfo — a URL in somebody's markup
//     can carry a token in any of the three, and a report naming the host is
//     as actionable as one naming the address.
//
//   - **Nothing found here is ever fetched.** This reads what a page says it
//     loads. It does not load it. No path is constructed, no link followed, no
//     script retrieved: N7 is unchanged by this package, which is the point of
//     putting the reading here rather than in the prober.
//
//   - **Bounded and streamed.** At most MaxBytes, read through a limit rather
//     than into memory twice. Past the bound, Truncated says so and nothing
//     below it was seen.
//
// # Why a scanner and not a parser
//
// There is no HTML parser in the standard library, and this project has no
// third-party dependencies. Writing a conforming parser would be a large piece
// of security-sensitive code to hold nobody has asked for; what a check needs
// is the start tags and a few of their attributes, and that is a scanner.
//
// It follows that this sees less than a browser does, and the limit says so
// rather than the report implying otherwise (R4). Markup assembled by a script
// at run time is invisible here, because nothing here executes anything.
