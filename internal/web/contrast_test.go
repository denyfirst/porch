// A report that cannot be read is a report that misleads.
//
// The stylesheet opens by saying that what could not be measured is set in the
// same weight as what could, "because a reader who is not told what was
// skipped will read silence as a clean result". The weight was equalised and
// the colour was not: measured in a browser on 2026-09-02, the faint ink came
// to 3.11:1 against paper in the light scheme, and it carries the coverage
// line, the count of what was observed and not graded, the pointer to the
// standing limits, and the words "not measured" — the whole of what a reader
// has to see in order not to mistake silence for a clean result. The amber of
// a weak verdict came to 3.60:1 against the paper a finding is drawn on, on
// the one word the report exists to deliver.
//
// So the threshold is checked here rather than left to taste.

// The ratio a reader with ordinary vision needs at the sizes this page uses.
// Every text on a report is below 24px, and below 18.66px where it is bold, so
// the large-text allowance of 3:1 never applies and is not offered here.
