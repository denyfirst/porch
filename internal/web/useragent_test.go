// Every request this project makes to a stranger names the tool that made it.
//
// The user agent is the one string an administrator has when a scan turns up in
// their access log, and N7 rests on it: a probe that identifies itself is one
// they can make a decision about, where an anonymous one is one they can only
// be alarmed by. That only works if the name is the instrument's.
//
// It says "porch" rather than "denyfirst" since 2026-09-12. denyfirst is the
// brand this is published under and it will carry more than one product; a log
// line naming the brand tells an administrator which company reached them and
// not which tool, which is the wrong half of the answer when they are trying to
// work out what was sent.
//
// Four strings, one identity, and a sabotage putting the brand back escaped
// every test in this repository. This is that test.
