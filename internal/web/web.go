// Package web serves the pages a person sees.
//
// Everything is embedded in the binary. That is not only a convenience: a
// handler that reads from disk has a path to get wrong, a directory that can
// be listed, and a traversal to defend. An embedded filesystem has fixed
// contents decided at build time, so none of those questions arise.
//
// The routes are an explicit table rather than a file server. The same
// reasoning applies as to hostname characters elsewhere in this project:
// listing what is allowed cannot be surprised by something nobody thought to
// forbid.
//
// Pages share one layout. Four copies of a header would be four places for
// it to drift, and a footer that disagrees with itself is a small thing that
// costs more than it looks on a site whose argument is that it can be
// checked. Each page is a fragment; the shell is applied once at startup and
// the result is served as fixed bytes.

// internal/web that forbids innerHTML in app.js, moved from build time to run
// time. The test reads the file this repository ships; the header binds the

// second is the one a user is exposed to, so a page that argues its script
// cannot reach a markup parser should say so where a browser can enforce it.
