  Every node on this page is built with createElement and textContent.
  innerHTML, insertAdjacentHTML, document.write and outerHTML appear nowhere,
  and a test in internal/web asserts that they never will.

  The reason is specific rather than general. A successful scan returns the
  target the caller sent, by design, and hostnames are attacker-chosen. The
  moment that value reaches a markup parser it stops being data. Building
  nodes directly means there is no parser to reach: a string assigned to
  textContent is a string, whatever it contains.

// screen, which is a defect this project found in its own command line output.

  The direction of that error is what makes it worth a fix rather than a note.

  servers with it on the strength of a handshake that never happened. The

  What was not measured, kept in proportion to how much it matters.

  A reader who is not told what was skipped will read silence as a clean
  result, so this is never omitted. But three paragraphs of caveat under a
  clean report is its own kind of noise, and a reader who meets it every time
  stops reading it — which produces the same silence by a longer route.

  So the summary is always visible and always counts them, and the detail
  opens on request. Except where it is the whole story: a report that graded
  nothing has nothing else to say, and there the limits are the finding.

  That exception was once extended to an insecure verdict as well, and the
  reasoning above never covered it. A report that graded a server insecure
  has findings, a version table, a cipher list and a certificate: the limits
  are a footnote there exactly as they are under a strong verdict, and
  opening them by default said otherwise. Nothing is hidden either way —
  the count sits in the summary line whether the block is open or shut.

  line. This runs an estate's checks for the person who runs the estate, and
  the two audiences want opposite things: one wants the argument, the other
  wants the answer and the evidence under it.

  What it is not is a second renderer. Every section here is built by the same

  cannot say one thing on one page and something else on the other — which is
  R16, and which this project has already had to fix twice.

  Sequential rather than parallel, for two reasons. Each check spends a token
  from the scanned host's budget, and three at once from one page is the shape
  the budget exists to discourage. And a section that appears as it finishes is
  a page that is doing something, where three that appear together after nine
