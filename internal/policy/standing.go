// The limits of the instrument, in one place.
//
// A standing limit is true of every scan this program runs. It says nothing
// about the host in front of it, which is exactly why repeating it on every
// report is how it stops being read — and why, when it sat under the same
// heading as everything else a report could not settle, it made each scan
// look as though it had failed at something.
//
// They are declared here rather than at the places that mention them so
// that the page explaining them and the reports referring to them cannot say
// different things. That is R16's argument applied to a third renderer: one
// set of facts, however many faces read it.
//
// The identifiers are stable. They are the anchors on the page, so a report
// that points at one is pointing somewhere that will still exist.

// StandingLimit is one property of this program that no host can change.
type StandingLimit struct {
	// ID is the anchor on the page that explains it. Stable across releases.
	ID string

	// Title is the heading it appears under.
	Title string

	// Text is the sentence itself, in the words a report used to carry.
	Text string

// Note renders the limit as a note, so that a caller cannot write a standing
// sentence that is not one of these.

// The set. Adding one means adding it here and nowhere else; the page picks
// it up, and a test fails if a report carries a standing sentence this list
// does not contain.
//
// Nothing here names how many there are. The count is read from the list at
// render time on both faces, because a sentence saying "four" is a sentence
// that goes stale the day a fifth is written — the same defect as a change
// log section that still says "Unreleased" five releases after it shipped.
