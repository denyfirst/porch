// web verdict comes from an HTTP response, which half the ports this project
// scans do not have. Folding them into one version would mean a rule about a
// header changing the number printed on a mail server's report, and two
// reports of the same host becoming incomparable for a reason that has
// nothing to do with what changed.
//
// v2, 2026-09-05. Two verdicts change, in the same direction and for the
// same reason: this rule set said nothing where it had measured something.
//
// A correctly reached site was graded ungraded, which means "nothing was
// established" and is what an unreachable host gets. The check had in fact
// established a great deal — that the policy is sound, that nothing answers
// in the clear — and reporting that as an absence made a correct site
// indistinguishable from one that never answered, on a command line where
// the exit status is the whole product.
//
// And a host that answered nothing over TLS was graded weak for declaring no
// policy, which is a claim about a server this program never spoke to.
