//
// What is graded here is narrow on purpose, and the line is the one the cookie
// rules drew: grade where a specification calls something an error, or where the
// configuration authorises everybody, and report everything else.
//
// There is a great deal of advice about mail policy and most of it is advice. A
// domain sitting at "~all" while it works out which of its departments still
// send through a forgotten relay is doing the right thing in the right order,
// and a scanner that marked it down would be penalising a correct decision —
// which is the failure R6 and R21 are about, and the one this project objects
// to in other tools.
//
// What is not advice is a permanent error. RFC 7208 says a policy with more
// than ten resolving terms, more than two void lookups, or more than one record
// is a permerror; receivers that hit one act as though the domain published
// nothing. The domain believes it has a policy. It does not. That is a
// measurement, not an opinion, and every graded rule below is one of those.

// MailVersion identifies the mail rule set.
//
// A name of its own rather than a number shared with the others, for the reason
// the TLS name carries its check: "denyfirst-v1" over a mail report and over a
// TLS report would be one name for two rule sets, which is exactly the
// confusion the naming exists to prevent.
