// The rest of the chain.
//
// Until 2026-09-02 all twenty-four certificate rules looked at the
// certificate served for the host and at nothing else. The chain was checked
// for trust — does it reach a root — and never for strength. A report said
//
//	Chain   4 certificates, trusted
//
// beside a strong verdict, and three of those four had been graded by
// nothing. An intermediate signed with SHA-1, or holding a 1024-bit key,
// passed in silence.
//
// It matters more on an issuer than on a leaf. A forged leaf impersonates the
// names inside it. A forged intermediate issues certificates for any name at
// all, and every client that trusts the chain accepts them — which is the
// same argument cert.leaf-is-ca rests on, arriving from the other direction.
//
// Nothing new is asked of the server: these are bytes the handshake already
// delivered.
//
// # What is deliberately not graded
//
// Names. A wildcard shape, a missing subject alternative name, a common name
// outside the SAN list are questions about a certificate presented for a
// name. An issuer is not presented for one.
//
// Self-signature. A root is self-signed; that is what a root is, and
// cert.self-signed would fire on every complete chain.
//
// Validity length. An authority is issued for ten or twenty years by design.
// The leaf's limit would fire on every chain ever served.
//
// Being an authority, and holding keyCertSign. On an issuer both are
// required rather than suspect — the exact inverse of the leaf rules.
//
// # And the root is not graded at all
//
// A root is trusted because the client already holds a copy, not because of
// the signature it carries. Nobody verifies that signature: a client that did
// would be asking the certificate to vouch for itself. So grading a root's
// own signature or key would raise an alarm about a risk no client is
// exposed to — and roots predating SHA-256 are still in every store, doing no
// harm. Any self-signed certificate in the chain is therefore skipped, which
// is how a client treats it too.

// IssuerFacts is one certificate between the leaf and the root.
