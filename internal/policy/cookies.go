// The cookie rules, and the line between what is graded and what is reported.
//
// Every cookie a site sets is visible in the response headers, and until now
// this rule set read none of them. What follows grades exactly the cases where
// a browser's own behaviour settles the question, and reports the rest.
//
// R21 is the whole of the distinction and it is easy to get wrong here,
// because there is a large body of advice about cookies and almost none of it
// is a line anybody published. "Set HttpOnly on every cookie" is good advice
// and is not a rule: a CSRF token, a locale, a consent flag and a feature
// switch are all cookies a page is meant to read, and this check cannot tell
// which it is looking at — deliberately, since Cookie has nowhere to hold a
// value. A rule that failed those servers would be this project inventing a
// threshold nobody can argue with, which is the failure R21 exists to name.
//
// What is graded instead is the set of cases where the cookie does not work.
// A browser rejects a __Host- cookie that breaks its prefix, rejects
// SameSite=None without Secure, and sends a cookie without Secure over
// plaintext. Those are not opinions about configuration; they are what happens
// next, and a site that has one of them is usually the last to know, because
// every symptom appears somewhere other than the header.
