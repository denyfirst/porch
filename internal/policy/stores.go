// What other clients' root stores make of a chain, described and never graded.
//
// The verdict on a chain rests on one store — the machine's own on Linux, the
// carried copy of the platform's programme on Windows and macOS — because that
// is the store a deployment checked and can stand behind (R7). But
// that is one store among several, and the question an operator actually has is
// whether the people connecting to them will be refused. Mozilla, Chrome,
// Microsoft and Apple each answer that for their own users, from copies of their
// stores dated in the report. None of it moves a verdict: which clients matter is
// the operator's to decide, and a rule choosing for them would be a threshold
// this project invented (R21).

// StoreTrust is what one client's root store makes of a chain.
