// Certificate status stapling, graded.
//
// This rule set is unusual in that its most obvious rule is deliberately not
// written. Most scanners mark a server down for not stapling an OCSP
// response, and until recently that was defensible. It is not any more.
//
// The CA/Browser Forum made OCSP optional for certificate authorities and
// required CRLs instead, and authorities have taken them up on it: a
// certificate issued today may name no OCSP responder at all. Grading a
// server as weak for failing to staple a response that nothing exists to
// produce would penalise a current, correct configuration — which is the
// exact failure this project objects to in other tools, and which the version
// rules already avoid by grading only what a server accepts rather than what
// it refuses.
//
// So absence of a staple is reported as a fact and explained in a note, and
// only one thing here is graded: a certificate that demands stapling and does
// not get it. That is not a matter of opinion. A client honouring RFC 7633
// closes the connection.
//
// If this project later decides that a missing staple deserves a verdict, the
// place to add it is marked below. Adding it is a policy change and belongs in
// a new policy version, not in a patch to this one — a user who scans an
// unchanged server twice and gets two grades has been given a reason to
// distrust both.
