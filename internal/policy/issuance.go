// Certificate authority authorisation, described rather than graded.
//
// A CAA record names the authorities allowed to issue for a domain. Without
// one, any publicly trusted authority may — and there are around a hundred, so
// the weakest of them sets the standard for everyone. Checking the record is
// mandatory for authorities under CA/Browser Forum rules, which makes it one
// of the few controls a domain owner can apply to authorities they have no
// relationship with.
//
// It is not graded, and the reason is where it comes from rather than what it
// says.
//
// Everything else this policy grades arrives in the handshake: a cipher suite,
// a protocol version, a certificate. CAA arrives from a resolver, over a path
// nothing here authenticates, describing a system the person who configured
// the server often does not administer. A verdict on the transport that moved
// because of a DNS record would be a verdict about somebody else's zone.
//
// So it is reported on a line of its own rather than folded into a note. That
// distinction matters more than it sounds: the notes fold shut under every
// verdict but ungraded, and for a name with no CAA this is likely the most
// useful sentence in the report — one DNS record, no risk in adding it, and a
// hundred authorities that stop being able to issue.
//
// # Prevention and detection
//
// CAA and certificate transparency answer two halves of one question: can
// somebody else obtain a certificate for this name, and would anybody find
// out. CAA acts before issuance and transparency after, and neither replaces
// the other. An authority checks CAA at the moment it issues, so a resolver
// poisoned at that moment lets the request through; and an authority that is
// itself compromised permits whatever it likes. The logs record the result
// either way.
//
// The two lines sit next to each other in the report for that reason.
