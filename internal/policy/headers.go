// The response header rules.
//
// The probe has collected thirteen headers since the check shipped and two of
// them were read. What follows reads the rest, and the line it draws is the
// same one the cookie rules draw: grade where the scan settles the
// consequence and no correct configuration produces it, report everything
// else.
//
// That line puts almost all of the well-known "security headers" on the
// reported side, and it is worth being plain about why, because a reader
// comparing this report against a commercial scanner will notice. Those tools
// award points and letter grades against thresholds they wrote themselves. A
// threshold nobody published is one nobody can argue with, which means nobody
// can correct it either, and it survives into a report telling somebody their
// correct decision is a fault. This project would rather report less and be
// worth reading.
//
// Reported is not hidden. The headers a site does not send are listed in one
// sentence, once, with what each one does — which is the list somebody closing
// gaps actually works from. What they are not given is a verdict that pretends
// a missing Permissions-Policy is a defect.

	// Beside Present rather than instead of it: a rule asks whether a header is
	// there, and a report says what it was. Thirteen headers were being recorded
	// by the probe, two of them graded and none of them shown — so an operator
	// reading a clean report could not tell a site that declares a content
	// policy from one that declares nothing, which is most of what they came to
	// find out.

	// the rule that lets a policy supersede X-Frame-Options could not see the
	// policy either. One omission, two sentences, both wrong, and both about
	// something the operator had already done.
	//
	// Separate from Present because they are not the same fact. A deployment
	// that reads no body leaves these false, and false here means "not seen"
	// rather than "not there" — so the absence of a header is reported as it
