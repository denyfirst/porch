// Package policy holds denyfirst's grading rules and the sources behind them.
//
// A scanner produces two different kinds of statement, and conflating them
// makes a report impossible to argue with.
//
// A fact comes from the handshake: this server accepted this cipher suite,
// whose key exchange is static RSA and whose mode is CBC. Facts do not change
// unless the server changes.
//
// A verdict is a judgement about that fact: static RSA is unacceptable. There
// is no single authority for such judgements. The IETF, NIST, the German BSI,
// Mozilla, and the CA/Browser Forum all publish recommendations, and they do
// not always agree. Go's crypto/tls carries its own opinion in
// InsecureCipherSuites, which is reasonable but is not a standard and has
// already moved suites between categories between releases.
//
// Inheriting a verdict from any of those means the tool's answer changes when
// the upstream opinion changes, with no record of why. A user who scans the
// same unchanged server twice and gets two different grades has been given a
// reason to distrust both.
//
// So the rules live here, versioned, each with the document it rests on. Go's
// list is kept as a cross-check in the tests rather than as the source of
// truth: if Go condemns something these rules do not, that is a signal to
// revisit the rules, not to change the answer silently.

// TLSVersion identifies this rule set. Every report states which version graded
// it, so a verdict can be reproduced later even after the rules move on.
//
// v2, 2026-08-22. Two suites change verdict and one changes its reason:
// finite-field DHE is now insecure rather than strong, because RFC 10015 made
// it MUST NOT; a suite this rule set does not recognise is now weak and says
// so, rather than insecure for a reason invented about it; and integrity-only
// suites are graded for the encryption they lack rather than for forward
// secrecy they have. A rule change is a version change, because a user who
// scans an unchanged server twice and gets two grades has been given a reason
// to distrust both.
//
// The name carries the check as well as the number, because a number on its
// own stops meaning one thing the moment this project runs a second check. A
// report says which rule set graded it so that two reports can be compared;
// "denyfirst-v7" over a mail report and "denyfirst-v7" over a TLS report
// would be the same name over two different rule sets, which is the exact
// confusion the name exists to prevent.
//
// Renamed and not renumbered. No rule moved with the name, so a report graded
// denyfirst-v6 and a report graded denyfirst-tls-v6 are comparable, and
// docs/policy-changes.md says so rather than leaving a reader to guess.
//
// The identifier followed the value on 2026-09-04, when WebVersion arrived.
// The argument is the same one, applied one level up: `policy.Version` beside
// `policy.WebVersion` reads as the general version and the web one, which is
// exactly the confusion renaming the value was meant to end. No rule moved
// with this either; it is a name, and every value it names is unchanged.
// v7, 2026-09-11. One new way to reach an existing verdict: cert.revoked can
// now be raised by a revocation list published by the issuing authority, and
// not only by a stapled response. No rule changed its meaning and no threshold
// moved — but a certificate whose revocation was previously unknowable can now
// come back insecure, and that is a verdict change on an unchanged server,
// which is a version change.

// compare. Somebody reading a console that offers four rule sets and one of
