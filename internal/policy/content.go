//
// The first rules in this project that rest on a response body, and the line
// they draw is the one every other section here draws: grade where a
// specification settles the consequence, report everything else.
//
// It happens to be an unusually clean line for this subject. The W3C Mixed
// Content specification does not advise — it divides plaintext subresources on
// a secure page into two sets and says what a user agent does with each.
// Scripts, stylesheets, frames and plugin data are *blockable*: a browser
// refuses them, so the resource does not arrive and the page is running without
// it. Images and media are *optionally-blockable*, and what a browser does with
// those is deliberately left open, so this project says what it saw and stops
// there (R21).
//
// A form is neither. A browser submits it, with a warning, so what is typed
// into it travels in the clear — which is the only rule here that is about the
// visitor rather than about the page.
