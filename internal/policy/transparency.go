// Certificate transparency, described rather than graded.
//
// A publicly trusted certificate has to be recorded in append-only logs, and
// each log answers with a signed receipt. Browsers refuse a certificate that
// arrives without enough of them. That sounds like something to grade, and it
// is not, for two reasons.
//
// The receipts reach a client three ways: embedded in the certificate, sent as
// a handshake extension, or carried inside a stapled status response. Nothing
// here reads a status response, so a certificate showing none of the first two
// may still be presenting them by the third. Grading on two channels out of
// three would fail a working configuration, which is the mistake the version
// rules and the stapling rules both exist to avoid.
//
// And the requirement itself is not ours to enforce. How many receipts, from
// how many logs, and which logs count are decided by each browser and revised
// on their schedule. A rule here would either copy a policy that moves without
// us or invent one nobody follows.
//
// So the numbers are reported, what they exclude is stated, and the reader is
// left to compare them against whichever client they care about.

// TransparencyFacts is what the certificate and the handshake each carried.

	//
	// It is the third delivery channel, and this is the only thing said about

	// fact something it declined to look at.
	Stapled bool

	// Trusted reports whether the chain reached a root in the trust store.
