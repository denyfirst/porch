// Package results keeps a deployment's own scans, when it is asked to.
//
// This project records nothing about a scan by default and that is the promise
// it is built on. The promise was never "storage is bad": it was that
// denyfirst.dev is the visible party in somebody else's logs and cannot say who
// asked, so holding other people's scanning behaviour would make it a
// repository worth seizing. None of that reasoning survives the move to an
// installation somebody runs themselves — there the scans are of their own
// estate, on their own machine, because they asked.
//
// So the promise is stated the way it is actually true:
//
//	This installation holds nothing about anyone but you.
//
// On the demonstration nothing is stored at all, and that stays absolute.
// Elsewhere what is stored is the report that was already produced, written
// where the operator said to write it, and only because they said so.
//
// # What this deliberately does not do
//
// **It is not served over HTTP.** A service with a browsable history of an
// estate's weaknesses is a thing worth attacking, and porchd has no
// authentication at all. Reading the store back is the command line's job,
// which runs on the operator's own machine and exposes nothing to a network.
// Offering it over HTTP is a separate decision with an authentication system
// attached, and one made deliberately rather than as a side effect of being
// able to write files.
//
// **It invents no retention period.** A number this project chose would be a
// threshold nobody can argue with, which is the failure R21 is written about,
// applied to somebody's disk instead of to their configuration. Keep is the
// operator's to set; unset keeps everything and says so.
//
// **It stores no more than a report already carries.** The same JSON, which has
// nowhere to put markup, a cookie's value, a client address or a time beyond a
// date. Writing it down does not relax what a report may contain.
