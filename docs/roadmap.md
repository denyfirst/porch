# Where this is going

Decisions that are made, work that is next, and defects that are known. Kept
here rather than in anybody's notes, for the reason `docs/releasing.md` opens
with: a thing that lives in a chat window and in nobody's repository is in the
wrong place.

## Decided

**The tool is what you run. The site is a demonstration of it.**

Until 2026-09-03 anybody could point denyfirst.dev at any host on the internet
and this project's server opened the connections. That is the worst position
available: ours was the address in the scanned party's logs, and we had
deliberately made ourselves unable to say who had asked, because recording
that is the one thing this project undertakes not to do. There were two ways
out — start keeping records, which is not available, or stop connecting to
third parties. This is the second.

**The demonstration is complete about what it scans, and honest about what it
does not offer.** A report shown on the site shows everything that report
established, including whatever is wrong with our own host. What the site
limits is *which hosts* and *which checks* it will run, and it says so plainly
rather than hiding a finding behind an invitation to self-host. A report with
parts removed would be an advertisement, and the whole credibility of this
project rests on it not being one.

**No accounts, no records, on the deployment this project runs.** Anything
that needs an account is a feature of the tool other people run, not of the
service we do.

**A record at a domain covers every name under it.** Proving `example.com`
proves `www.example.com` and every name added later, because a TXT record
proves control of a zone. The pages ask for the name's own record unless the
operator picks a domain above it, and say what that gives away (A04, D05).

**The command line needs no proof.** Proof and a password protect a service:
somebody else's machine and address, used by whoever reaches it. `porch-scan`
runs on the machine of the person asking, from their address, under their
responsibility, as `openssl` and `curl` do. A restriction there would be one
line anyone could delete from source that is published to be read, and
pretending otherwise would be the kind of claim this project does not make
(A30).

## Next, in order

### 1. The web check's service surface

**The web check has its service surface**, since 2026-09-10: `POST
/api/v1/web/scan`, `/web`, and `/web/method`. What is left is a report that
runs every check against one name and gives one verdict for it, with an
explicit list of what none of them established.

`/` is no longer part of that, and this paragraph said it was until
2026-09-25. Both builds have had a root of their own since 2026-09-12 — the
demonstration explains the project, an installation opens on a field — and
nothing redirects there any more. What is outstanding is the combined report,
not an address to put it at.

The endpoint inherited the demonstration guard and the exclusion list rather
than repeating them, because both are asked in `webscan.Scanner.Scan`. It
walks the same chain of guards the TLS endpoint does — there is one chain,
described per check rather than copied per endpoint, and N6 says why.

The method page came before the page a visitor scans from, because the web
probe has been naming that address in other people's access logs since the
endpoint landed and it answered 404 (N7). It is written for the log reader
first.

**The counters were settled first.** Each check has its own block naming its
own rule set; the fields at the top of a `Snapshot` are still the TLS check's,
spelled the same and counting the same thing, and the `tls` block repeats
them. Nothing published moved, so a reader of `/api/v1/stats` and a rollback
to an older binary both keep figures that mean what they meant. R22 has the
reasoning.

**The privacy page says what is kept**, and since 2026-09-10 it says all of it:
the four verdict counts rather than three, the day's total and the two dates,
the block each check keeps under its own rule set, and the refusals counted by
reason. Nothing new is recorded — no hostname, no address, no time — the page
had simply fallen behind what `/api/v1/stats` publishes, which made it useless
for the one thing it is for. It is pinned to the type now rather than to
somebody's memory: every figure in the published snapshot has to be described
on the page or a test fails.

### 2. Scope: prove control of a domain before scanning it

**The boundary is built and is opt-in**, since 2026-09-10: `internal/verify`,
asked in both scanners beside the demonstration list, and
`-verification-secret-file` on the service. Both challenge methods are there —
a TXT record for the zone, a file for one hostname — and a file does not open a
check that leaves the ports a browser uses. N9 has the reasoning.

It was asked in both scanners and configured on one. `httpapi.New` built the
web check from nothing, so a service that set a scope refused an unproven host
on `/api/v1/tls/scan` and measured it on `/api/v1/web/scan` — every guard in
place, every unit test passing, and no boundary on half the surface. The
constructor now hands the boundary to every check it builds, `UseWebScanner`
cannot drop it, and the test drives the `POST` routes read out of the source
rather than a list somebody has to remember to extend.

**The default is on.** Beyond loopback `porchd` will not start without a
verification secret unless `-open` is said, nor without a password unless
`-without-password` is; the image and the compose file carry both. The
reviews of 2026-09-16 (A01, A07) and 2026-09-18 (D01) are closed by that, and
v0.18.0 said so in its release note.

**[`docs/scope.md`](scope.md) is the design**, settled: the two scopes and the
one methodology they share, what a verified domain
does and does not authorise, why the two challenge methods grant different
things, what verification is not a reason to retire, and which of the public
deployment's restrictions belong to the deployment rather than to the check.
Read it before changing any of this. What follows is the summary.

A deployment should be able to require that a domain has been verified before
it will scan it — DNS TXT at `_porch-challenge.<domain>`, or a file at
`/.well-known/porch-challenge` for teams without DNS access.

This is a property of the tool, not a service anybody runs for anybody else.
It costs this project nothing in records, because this project is not in the
path.

What it buys is the thing that currently stops an organisation from putting a
self-hosted `porchd` on its own network: without it, an internal
deployment where anyone can type a hostname is the arrangement this project
dismantled, rebuilt inside somebody's intranet. With it, an installation can
only reach estates it has proven control of — which also survives a careless
colleague, a compromised CI job, and an SSRF into the scanner.

Defaults differ because the threat models differ, and this is the part to get
right:

| | default | why |
|---|---|---|
| `porch-scan`, in a terminal | off | whoever runs it already has the machine; nobody else can reach it |
| `porchd`, a service | **on** | anything anyone can reach must not scan arbitrary hosts |

Architecturally it is a sibling of `internal/demo`: the same boundary, asked
in the same place, from a different source of authority — one compiled in, one
established at run time.

### 3. Mail

SPF with its ten-lookup and void-lookup limits, DMARC and alignment, MTA-STS,
TLS-RPT, DANE on the MX hosts, DKIM under named selectors, and STARTTLS on the
exchangers. Beyond DNS it makes two kinds of request — the MTA-STS policy file
the zone announces, and a greeting, EHLO, STARTTLS and QUIT with each exchanger —
and both only where the command line runs them or a service has proof of control.
See N13. Where an exchanger publishes DANE, its records are checked against the
certificate it presents, as RFC 7672 has a sender check them.

Two things about it are settled in advance, because both are easier to get
right before the check exists than after.

**Only the zone proof authorises it.** A `TXT` record proves control of the
zone, which is where every one of these records lives. The `.well-known` file
proves control of one host's HTTP surface, so a file on a web server says
nothing about the zone's `MX`. That stays true now that the MTA-STS policy is
fetched: the policy file is read because the zone announced it, and the right to
read it still comes from the zone proof, not from the file proof.
`internal/verify` already draws that line — the file half is offered only for a
surface that reads HTTP — and mail asks for the other one. Its name will want
revisiting when this is built: what the mail check needs is not "any port", it
is "the zone proof", and a name that describes the consequence rather than the
requirement is a name somebody eventually reads backwards.

**The check takes a domain, and the part before the `@` is discarded on
arrival.** These are questions about `example.com`, never about a mailbox, so
`test@example.com` is not needed and is not kept. A local part is a person's
identity; this project records neither hostnames nor addresses, and the way to
keep that true is to split the string where it arrives and let the left half go
before anything can log, count or report it. Accepting an address at all is a
convenience for whoever pastes one — so the page has to say plainly that the
left half is dropped, rather than leaving somebody to trust that it was.

### 4. Results kept on the machine that made them

Done. `-results-dir` on either program writes the date, the check, the rule set,
the verdict and the rules raised; `porch-scan -history` reads them back and says
where in a history the rules changed.

The promise was never "storage is bad". It was that the public deployment is
the visible party in somebody else's logs and cannot say who asked, which makes
holding other people's scanning behaviour a repository worth seizing. None of
that survives the move to a machine somebody runs themselves, so the sentence is
now the one that is actually true: **this installation holds nothing about
anyone but you.**

Never served over HTTP, and that is the part to keep. A browsable history of an
estate's weaknesses is a thing worth attacking and `porchd` has no
authentication at all. Offering it over HTTP is a separate decision with an
authentication system attached, made deliberately rather than as a side effect
of being able to write files.

### Later

The certificate's own responder can now be asked from the command line with
`-ask-responder` (R3a).

**Checking a company's inside, if companies ask.** Every check here measures
how the world reaches you, and a service refuses private and reserved
addresses everywhere. An intranet's TLS is the one thing worth reading from
inside, and doing it safely is more than a switch: an operator setting given at
start, never a button a signed-in person presses, naming the networks allowed;
never on the demonstration; and the company's own certificate authority read
beside it, so an internal certificate is not graded against rules written for
public ones. The review of 2026-09-16 raised both halves (A29, A33). Not built
until somebody running this inside a company asks for it.

**Two smaller bounds on the second hosts a proven domain names** (A05). A
proven domain's MX records send the mail check to its exchangers, and a
certificate sends the revocation check to the list it names; both are what a
mail server and a browser do, and neither needs proof of its own. Still, a
revocation list could be fetched only once the chain reaches a trusted root,
and each exchanger could have a budget of its own across every domain naming
it. Each changes what a report can say, so each waits for a rule-set version.

## Known defects

**Each address of a name is asked one handshake, not scanned.** Every address
a name resolves to — up to eight — is now asked on its own, and the report says
whether they answered alike, so a misconfigured machine the resolver did not
offer is no longer missed. What one handshake shows is the version, suite and
certificate a client is given. A machine that differs only in what else it
would accept — an old version or a weak suite behind the same preferred answer —
looks identical from there.

---

## Not doing

**Exploitation, credential guessing, fuzzing somebody else's service, state
change, port sweeps, scanning at scale, or CVE guesses matched from a version
string.** None of these was ever a logging question, and none of them became
available when this project stopped being a public intermediary. The last is
where most scanners lose their readers' trust.

**Nothing malformed is ever sent**, and the reason has changed, so it is
written down rather than left to be inferred from the line above.

The old reason was that the server belongs to somebody else. Once a deployment
scans only estates it has proven control of, that reason is weak: it is your
own server, and looking at it harder is your decision. Three reasons survive
and none of them is about the scanned party.

A tool that sends deliberately broken input is a weapon in whoever's hands it
ends up in. This one is meant to be installed by a company to check itself,
and the property that makes that safe is that the worst a careless colleague
can do with it is read a page. That property is worth more than any finding it
costs.

Several of these probes can destabilise the service they are aimed at, and a
check that can take down the thing it is checking is not a check anybody runs
on a Tuesday afternoon.

And the class has a poor accuracy record. A false "vulnerable to ROBOT" sends
a team after a week of work that was never needed; a false "clean" is worse.
This project's whole argument is that its answers can be relied on, and a
family of checks that has historically been wrong in both directions is a bad
trade for a report that is otherwise checkable line by line.

**What is given up is smaller than it looks, and where it is given up the
report says so.** Almost everything reachable by malformed input is either
reachable by a fuller ordinary handshake — a wider ClientHello, the offered
suites, the parameters a server volunteers — or has a precondition that is
plainly visible. A Bleichenbacher oracle can only exist behind a static RSA
key exchange, and that is graded `insecure` on sight; the finding now says
what confirming the oracle would take, that this tool does not do it, and that
the remedy is the same instruction either way. A reader loses the confirmation
and keeps the action.

**Accounts or scan history on denyfirst.dev.** *I do not have the data to
begin with* is a stronger statement than any policy, and it is not a claim to
retire by accident. If it is ever retired it will be a separate, deliberate
decision with terms, a data-processing agreement and an abuse process behind
it.

**A subscription, for now.** If this becomes something organisations want, the
thing they pay for is continuous monitoring, inventory, evidence for auditors,
integrations and support — around a tool they run themselves. None of that
requires this project to hold anybody's scan history.
