# What changed between policy versions

Every verdict this project produces carries the name of the rule set that
produced it, and reports from two different rule sets are not comparable. A
server graded `strong` under `denyfirst-v1` and `weak` under `denyfirst-v2`
may not have changed at all.

This page says what moved, so that anyone whose pipeline reads the output can
tell a configuration that got worse from a rule that got stricter.

The rule identifiers are stable across releases. A finding can be tracked or
suppressed by its identifier rather than by matching prose, and the prose is
free to improve without breaking that.

---

## The tool is called porch

Every rule set is named `porch-<check>-vN` from this release. They were
`denyfirst-<check>-vN`.

**No rule changed and no verdict moved.** This is the name of the instrument,
not a change to what it measures. `denyfirst` is the brand these rules are
published under and it is going to carry more than one product; a rule set named
for the brand says which company graded a report and not which tool did.

**The numbers did not reset.** `denyfirst-tls-v7` became `porch-tls-v7`, not
`porch-tls-v1`. Resetting would have told a reader the rules were new when they
are the same rules under a different name — which is the one thing a version on
a rule set exists to prevent.

**Nothing anybody holds is affected.** All three of the rule sets renamed here
were unreleased: `denyfirst-tls-v7`, `denyfirst-web-v3` and `denyfirst-mail-v1`
never appeared in a report. The sections below name the last released rule set on
each side of the change, so a reader comparing an older report against a new one
is reading the whole story rather than a rename spliced into it. Sections for
releases that did ship keep the names they shipped under, because that is what
those reports say.

The programs are `porch-scan` and `porchd`, and the user agent is `porch/1`. The
addresses under `denyfirst.dev` are unchanged: that is the brand's domain, the
pages explaining what a scan sends are there, and a log reader who looked one up
is entitled to find it still answering.

## `porch-mail-v1` → `porch-mail-v2`

Released in v0.19.0, 2026-09.

Two findings are added, and nothing that was graded before is graded
differently. A domain whose report was strong under `porch-mail-v1` is strong
under this one unless one of its own exchangers is an open relay, or an
exchanger it names is an alias.

### An exchanger whose name is an alias

`mail.exchanger-is-an-alias`, graded `weak`.

RFC 2181 says the name an MX record points at carries an address and is not an
alias. A sender looking it up asks for the address at the name it was given,
and what it does with the alias it finds instead differs between
implementations — so mail from some senders arrives and mail from others does
not, which is the hardest kind of delivery problem to find. The question is
asked of the name itself, because an exchanger whose name is an alias still
resolves and nothing else read here would show it.

### An exchanger that forwards mail for a domain it does not serve

`mail.open-relay`, graded `insecure`.

This is the oldest misconfiguration in mail and still the most expensive one
to have. A server that accepts mail from anybody, for anybody, is found within
hours of being reachable, used to send in other people's names, and listed
everywhere that matters — after which the domain's own mail stops arriving.
RFC 2505, a best current practice, says an MTA must not relay for domains it
is not responsible for; RFC 5321 is the protocol it is said in.

**Which exchangers are asked, and no others.** The question goes to an
exchanger inside the domain being checked — `mail.example.com` when
`example.com` is the domain — and never to one belonging to somebody else. An
exchanger named by an MX record but run by a provider is that provider's
server: a relay probe in their logs reads as a spam probe, and the address it
came from is the one that gets listed for it. There is no flag to widen this.

**What is said, and what cannot happen.** An empty reverse path, which is what
every bounce carries and names nobody; a recipient under `.invalid`, which RFC
2606 reserves so that the name cannot exist; then `RSET`, which abandons the
transaction. `DATA` is never sent, so no message is ever composed, nothing is
queued, and a server that agreed was never handed anything to forward. What is
graded is what the server said it would do.

**Not asked is not refused.** An exchanger that was never asked, one that
refused the empty sender — which is a fact about bounces rather than about
relaying — and one whose conversation ended early are each reported as
themselves. Only a server that accepted the recipient is graded (R4).

This also changes what `internal/smtptls` may say, and `docs/invariants.md` N3
changes with it: the rule was that no sender or recipient is ever named, and it
is now that no message is ever composed, with the one question that names a
recipient bounded as above.

## `porch-dns-v1` → `porch-dns-v2`

Released in v0.20.0, 2026-09.

Two findings are added and nothing that was graded before is graded
differently. A domain whose report was strong under `porch-dns-v1` is strong
under this one unless the signatures over its zone have already run out, or the
zone above hands out an address for one of its servers that the zone itself does
not publish.

### A signature that has run out

`dns.signature-expired`, graded `insecure`.

RFC 4035 §5.3.1 requires a validating resolver to refuse a signature whose
validity period does not contain the current time. A zone whose signatures have
expired is therefore already gone for everybody behind one — the same outcome as
a chain that does not check out, and graded the same way. It is caused by
signing that stopped running rather than by anything anybody changed, which is
why nothing else in a report shows it.

**When the signatures run out is reported on every signed zone, and not
graded.** No document says how much room to leave, and a zone re-signed hourly
with a two-day window is as correct as one re-signed weekly with a month (R21).
The date and the key that made the signature are in the report; what to do about
them is the operator's own judgement about their own schedule.

The date costs no question. Every query this project sends already asks for
DNSSEC data, so a signed zone's answers carry the signature; until now nothing
read the one field in it a report can act on.

### An address the zone above hands out that the zone does not publish

`dns.glue-does-not-match`, graded `weak`.

A server inside the zone it serves cannot be looked up without being told where
it is, so the address its parent hands out beside the delegation — the glue — is
what a resolver starting at the root dials. The zone publishes the same address
itself, and the two can disagree: then whoever reaches the parent's copy reaches
whatever is at that address now, which may be a machine that no longer serves
the zone, and whoever reaches the zone's copy gets the zone. Which one a visitor
gets depends on their resolver, and nothing in the zone's own records can show
it.

RFC 1912 §2.3 describes both halves: an address left behind at the parent, where
"random people still see the old IP address", and a multi-homed server whose
addresses are not all listed in the glue, which it states as a requirement. The
finding names the address and the server, because it is changed at the registrar
rather than in the zone file.

A server outside the zone it serves has no glue, so nothing is compared and
nothing is said.

**Two things are now reported that were not, and neither is graded.** Whether
the servers hold the same copy of the zone, read from the serial each one
answers with; and whether the zone can be read whole by anybody, asked of every
server and never taken. Both are notes rather than findings, so no verdict moves
for either.

---

## `porch-dns-v1` — a new rule set

Released in v0.19.0, 2026-09.

A fourth rule set, for a fourth check: how a domain itself is served. **No TLS,
web or mail verdict changed.** Those three grade a handshake, an HTTP response
and a domain's mail policy; this one grades the delegation the domain is
answered through and the DNSSEC chain its parent anchors. A report carries the
rule set that graded it, and these four are never the same one.

Almost nothing is connected to. Every fact but a few comes from the resolver the
scanning machine already uses. The rest are put to servers directly, over TCP on
port 53 and through the guard that refuses private, loopback and reserved
destinations: whether each server answers for the zone, whether it hands the
whole zone to anybody who asks, — for a server inside the domain only — whether
it answers for other domains as well, and which servers the zone above hands
out. An installation asks them where control of the domain has been proven; the
command line asks them always.

A transfer is asked for and never taken: the first reply's header says whether
the server began one, the connection is closed there, and nothing the zone
contains is read or reported. Whether it can be read whole is reported and not
graded — RFC 5936 §5 says an implementation ought to let an operator open
transfers to everybody, while saying it must not be the default, so no document
calls it a fault (R21).

What it grades is deliberately short, and the reason is that DNS carries more
advice than any other part of the internet and fewer requirements. A serial
number in a particular shape and a refresh timer inside a particular range are
what other reports open with; RFC 1912 calls its ranges recommendations, and a
zone whose records are written through an interface has no reason to carry a
serial a person can read. Those are reported here, never graded (R21).

Five findings, each of which stops a resolver or contradicts a standard:

- `dns.one-name-server` — fewer than two name servers, which RFC 1034 requires
  and RFC 2182 (BCP 16) explains.
- `dns.name-servers-one-network` — every server answering from one network,
  judged by address prefix rather than by owner, because which organisation an
  address belongs to cannot be read from the address.
- `dns.name-server-without-address` — a server the zone names that resolves to
  nothing, which RFC 1912 calls a lame delegation.
- `dns.dnssec-no-keys` and `dns.dnssec-chain-broken` — the parent anchors
  DNSSEC and no key published here matches what it holds. This is the finding
  the check was built around: a key rotated without the registrar being told
  leaves every validating resolver answering with a failure while the
  operator's own browser is fine, so nobody finds out from their own machine.
- `dns.dnssec-sha1-digest` — a chain that works over a digest RFC 8624 says is
  not to be used for new delegations.
- `dns.alias-at-zone-apex` — a CNAME at the top of a zone, which RFC 1034 and
  RFC 2181 both forbid: resolvers that follow it lose the zone's mail and its
  name servers.
- `dns.name-server-not-authoritative` — a server the delegation names that,
  asked directly, answers without claiming the zone as its own. RFC 1912 calls
  it a lame delegation, and a resolver cannot show it: one that reached a
  working server reports a working zone.
- `dns.name-server-offers-recursion` — a server inside the domain that also
  answers questions about domains it has nothing to do with, which RFC 5358
  (BCP 140) says an authoritative server should not: it is what makes a server
  usable for pointing traffic at somebody else.
- `dns.parent-and-zone-disagree` — the zone above hands out a different set of
  servers from the one the zone itself names, which RFC 1912 asks it not to.
  A resolver starting at the root follows the parent's list, so a name only the
  parent hands out is where some lookups go and whatever is at that address
  answers them. A resolver cannot show this either: it answers an NS question
  from the zone itself, so only the parent's own server can be asked.
- `dns.name-server-is-an-alias` — a name in the delegation that is an alias,
  which RFC 2181 forbids for the same reason and which resolvers disagree
  about, so some reach the zone and others do not.
- `dns.dnssec-retired-algorithm` and `dns.dnssec-weak-algorithm` — signing with
  an algorithm RFC 8624 says must not be used, and with one it no longer
  recommends. The first is graded insecure because validators are dropping it;
  the second weak, because it still works.
- `dns.nsec3-iterations` — hashing absent names more than once, which RFC 9276
  (BCP 236) closed: the iteration count is zero, the extra work lands on every
  resolver and on this zone's own servers, and the secrecy it was meant to buy
  was measured and is not there.

The digest is computed here, from the keys the zone publishes, rather than
taken from the resolver's AD bit — that bit is the resolver's claim about work
it did, and where the report repeats it, it says whose word it is. A digest of
a type this does not compute is reported as neither matched nor ruled out.

Whether absent names are proved with hashed names or plain ones is reported
and not graded. Plain names let anybody list a zone; nothing requires the
hashed kind, and a zone whose names are not secret loses nothing by it.

An alias whose target does not exist is reported and not graded: no document
sets a rule about one. What the note says is what it leads to — the name
resolves to nothing, and where the target is a name at a provider that hands
out unclaimed ones, whoever claims it next answers for this name.

## `porch-mail-v1` — a new rule set

Released in v0.16.0, 2026-09.

A third rule set, for a third check: what a domain's DNS says about its mail.
**No TLS verdict changed and no web verdict changed.** `denyfirst-tls-v7`
grades a handshake, `denyfirst-web-v3` grades an HTTP response, and this one
grades records that are served by neither. A report carries the rule set that
graded it, and these three are never the same one.

Most facts in a mail report come out of a DNS lookup the resolver this machine
already uses would answer. Two do not, and both run only where the command line
runs them or a service has proof of control: the MTA-STS policy file a zone
announces, and a short conversation with each exchanger the zone names. No
message is composed or sent, no sender or recipient is named, and nothing that
would change state at the other end is attempted.

The finding it was built around is invisible in the record. RFC 7208 allows a
sender policy at most ten DNS-resolving terms across everything it pulls in;
past that the evaluation is a permanent error and a receiver behaves as though
the domain had published no policy. A domain can hold three `include` terms and
be over the limit because one of its providers has eight of its own, and
nothing an operator can read in their own zone shows it. The tooling that
usually reports this is a web form somebody types their domain into.

### What it grades

| rule | verdict | when |
|---|---|---|
| `mail.spf-duplicate` | insecure | more than one SPF record, which RFC 7208 makes a permanent error |
| `mail.spf-lookup-limit` | insecure | evaluating the policy takes more than the ten lookups RFC 7208 allows |
| `mail.spf-allows-everybody` | insecure | the policy ends in `+all`, authorising every sender on the internet |
| `mail.spf-void-lookups` | weak | more than the two lookups RFC 7208 allows return nothing |
| `mail.dmarc-duplicate` | weak | more than one DMARC record, so RFC 7489 says a receiver applies none |
| `mail.dmarc-no-policy` | weak | a DMARC record with no `p=`, which RFC 7489 requires |
| `mail.dkim-weak-key` | weak | an RSA signing key below the floor RFC 8301 sets, which a verifier may treat as insecure |
| `mail.mta-sts-policy-invalid` | weak | an MTA-STS policy with no `mode`, or none in `enforce`/`testing` naming no `mx`, both of which RFC 8461 requires |
| `mail.mta-sts-uncovered-exchanger` | weak | an enforcing MTA-STS policy matching none of the exchangers the domain publishes |
| `mail.mta-sts-exchanger-fails-policy` | weak | an exchanger an enforcing MTA-STS policy covers offers no STARTTLS, or a certificate that does not verify for its name |

Every one of those is a specification calling something an error, or a
configuration authorising everybody. There is no third kind.

The last two are the ones worth arguing about, and the argument is written
into each rule. An enforcing policy that does not match the domain's own `MX`, or
that covers an exchanger unable to offer STARTTLS with a certificate valid for
its name, is a break with a consequence RFC 8461 states outright — a sending
server **must not** deliver — so mail from every sender that honours MTA-STS is
queued and then returned. It is graded `weak` rather than `insecure` because it fails
*closed*: mail stops rather than crossing the network unprotected, and
`insecure` in every other rule here means a sender or a receiver was induced to
accept something it should not have. One word cannot mean both without making a
report harder to read than the configuration it describes, so the severity of
these is carried by their sentences.

**The SPF walk stops where a receiver stops.** Past ten lookups nothing more is
resolved and the count is reported as a lower bound; `mail.spf-lookup-limit` is
raised exactly as before. An included policy the resolver could not answer is
counted as unread rather than as a void lookup, so a resolver's failure no
longer counts towards `mail.spf-void-lookups`, and while any include is unread
the report is ungraded rather than strong.

**A domain whose records could not be read is ungraded, not strong.** Where the
sender policy, the DMARC record or the exchanger list could not be read, every
rule about it is silent, and silence is not a pass. Such a scan comes back
`ungraded` unless something that was read raised a finding.

### What it deliberately does not grade

**A domain with no SPF record.** Whether that matters depends on whether the
domain sends mail, and this check does not establish that. A domain that sends
none is correctly configured without one.

**`~all`, `?all`, or a record with no `all` at all.** A domain sitting at `~all`
while it finds the last department still sending through a forgotten relay is
doing the right thing in the right order. Moving to `-all` before the list is
complete rejects real mail, so a scanner marking it down would be reporting a
correct decision as a fault (R6, R21). The qualifier is described instead, with
what a receiver does about it.

**The lookup count, until it is over.** Nine of ten is reported on every report
that has a policy to count — a domain one provider away from switching its own
policy off has no other way to find that out — but nine is not a fault, because
RFC 7208 says ten.

**`p=none`, and `pct=` below 100.** The monitoring position and the rollout.
Both protect less than a stricter setting and both are the documented way to
reach one. Described, with what they mean for mail that fails.

**No `rua=`, and no TLS-RPT record.** Reports are how an operator finds out
what their policy is doing; a domain without them is flying blind rather than
misconfigured. Nothing is wrong without either. They are named because they are
the only way to find out that something is.

**`ptr`.** RFC 7208 says SHOULD NOT, and several large receivers ignore it.
That is a description with a document behind it, not an error the document
declares.

### The mail path

Three more things the DNS says, all reported and none graded.

**Which hosts accept the mail.** The `MX` records, named. How many a domain has
and whose they are is an operational decision no specification settles.

**A null MX.** RFC 7505's single `.` is a domain stating that it accepts no mail
at all, and it is the clearest case of a correct configuration a scanner could
mark down. It is read as the statement it is, and every sentence below it about
delivery is dropped rather than reported as unsatisfied (R6).

**MTA-STS and DANE.** Whether the domain announces an MTA-STS policy, and which
exchangers publish a DANE record. Neither is required by anything and they are
two competing answers to the same problem — an operator may reasonably deploy
either, both or neither — so a verdict on the choice would be a threshold this
project invented (R21). What the report does is name what is there, because an
operator choosing between them is owed the fact that at present they have
picked neither.

**What the MTA-STS policy says, where the deployment reads it.** The record at
`_mta-sts.<domain>` says a policy exists; the policy itself is a file at
`https://mta-sts.<domain>/.well-known/mta-sts.txt`, and only the file says
whether it is in `enforce`, `testing` or `none` mode. From DNS a policy that
protects the domain and one that has been rehearsing for two years look
identical, so the file is fetched — under four conditions. Only where the domain
announces a policy: no record, no request. Only where the deployment reads it:
the command line does, and a service does exactly where it requires proof of
control. One address, fixed by RFC 8461, no redirect followed, and the
certificate must verify for the policy host. And it is a web host, sent one GET.

`testing` and `none` are described and never graded: `testing` is the staging
position on the way to `enforce`, as `p=none` is for DMARC, and `none` is a
deliberate withdrawal. `max_age` is reported as a duration and compared to
nothing, because RFC 8461 sets no floor a scanner could hold a domain to. An
exchanger the policy does not match is graded under `enforce` and, under
`testing`, named with the consequence of moving to `enforce` as it stands —
nothing is failing yet, and that sentence is the reason to read the file at all.

A file that was fetched and is not a valid policy — no `version: STSv1`, no
mode or one RFC 8461 does not define, no `max_age`, no `mx` for a mode that
needs one, a repeated field, or more than the size bound — is graded
`mail.mta-sts-policy-invalid`, weak, with the reason, and nothing in it is used:
a sending server applies no MTA-STS from it. A policy naming more host patterns
than are kept is not compared with the exchangers, and the report says so.

A policy that could not be fetched is reported with its reason and graded for
nothing. A failure here looks the same whether the policy host is broken or this
machine's egress is blocked, and no measurement available from here tells them
apart.

Whether each DANE binding *holds* is checked where the exchangers are contacted,
against the certificate each presented, and said to be unchecked where they are
not — see below.

**What each exchanger answers when asked for encryption, where the deployment
asks.** An enforcing MTA-STS policy and a DANE record both promise that mail is
delivered encrypted, and only the exchanger can say whether it keeps that
promise. So each exchanger the domain's MX records name — at most eight — is
asked on port 25: the greeting, EHLO, STARTTLS, the handshake, QUIT. No sender,
recipient or message is ever named. The report says, per exchanger, whether it
offers STARTTLS, what was negotiated, and whether the certificate verifies for
its own name against the deployment's trust store.

Almost none of it is graded. RFC 3207 makes STARTTLS optional, and a sender
delivering opportunistically encrypts without checking the certificate, so an
exchanger without STARTTLS or with a certificate that fails is described (R21).
Where an enforcing MTA-STS policy covers the exchanger, RFC 8461 says a sender
must not deliver to it — so there it is graded,
`mail.mta-sts-exchanger-fails-policy`, weak for the reason the uncovered rule
is: it fails closed. An exchanger that offered STARTTLS and could not negotiate
with this client is not graded, because that is a limit of this client before it
is a fault of the server (R4).

**Whether each exchanger's DANE records hold for the certificate it presented.**
Checked as RFC 7672 has a sender check: DANE-EE(3) against the leaf, with no
name or date check; DANE-TA(2) against a presented certificate, which the leaf
must chain to and whose chain must name the exchanger. PKIX-TA and PKIX-EE, which
RFC 7672 sets aside for SMTP, undefined selectors and matching types, and digests
of the wrong length are reported as records no sender uses. Where a binding does
not hold — no record matches, or the exchanger offers no STARTTLS — and the
resolver reported the records validated, it is graded,
`mail.dane-exchanger-fails-binding`, weak: RFC 7672 has a sender hold the mail,
so it fails closed, as the enforcing MTA-STS rule does. Without the AD bit it is
named and not graded, because a sender applies only records that validate, and
the report says the bit is the resolver's word rather than a check this program
made. A bare DANE-TA key that no presented certificate carries, and an anchor past
its own dates, are reported as not established rather than as failures, and so is
every exchanger that presented no certificate to this client.

Outbound port 25 is blocked by many networks, residential connections and
hosting providers among them. Where no exchanger can be reached, the report says
that most likely describes where the scan ran rather than the exchangers (R3d),
and grades nothing.

The EHLO name is the client's own, as RFC 5321 says: `-helo` if given, else this
machine's fully qualified host name, else its address as a literal.

DANE is asked about beneath each exchanger, which is the one place this check
follows a name out of the target's own zone. The reasoning is the one that
already lets a sender policy's `include` be resolved: the domain published an
`MX` saying "this host takes my mail", so asking what that host publishes is
reading the domain's own answer rather than wandering off it. Bounded, because
the list is written by whoever is being measured.

### Signing keys, under selectors somebody names

A DKIM key lives at `<selector>._domainkey.<domain>` and DNS has no query for
what is beneath a name. There is no set of selectors to discover, so keys are
read under names this scan is told to look under: the operator's own, given with
`-dkim-selector`, and the ones mail providers document for their own service.

The second are on by default and that is a decision worth stating. Trying names
nobody mentioned looks like the guessing this project refuses everywhere — but
that rule is about constructing paths on somebody's *server*, where the request
lands in their access log and looks like an attack. A DNS lookup reaches the
zone rather than the host: a name that does not exist costs a resolver one
answer and the domain nothing at all, and a key that does exist is published for
every receiving mail server on the internet to read.

What keeps it honest is not withholding the lookup. It is that the report names
every selector it tried, and never turns *these names hold nothing* into *this
domain publishes no key*. A selector the operator named and one a provider
documents are reported differently for the same reason: they said theirs should
be there, so an absence is a fact; a provider default holding nothing is not.

The list is not one this project invented. Each entry is the name a provider
tells its own customers to create, and each carries the provider it belongs to
so a reader can check rather than take the file's word for it.

**One rule is graded: `mail.dkim-weak-key`.** RFC 8301 raised the floor to 1024
bits and says a verifier may treat anything shorter as insecure, so mail signed
with a smaller key can be discarded by a receiver applying the rule. That is a
measurement. Everything else about DKIM is reported: a key in testing mode
(`t=y`), which RFC 6376 tells a verifier not to act on; a revoked key, which is
an empty `p=` and a decision rather than a mistake; and which selectors held
nothing.

### An address may be given, and the part before the @ is discarded

Somebody checking a domain's mail policy has an address in front of them, and
pasting it is the natural thing to do. Refusing it teaches nothing.

So it is accepted and split at the last `@` — a quoted local part may contain
one and a domain may not — and the left half is gone before anything can log,
count or report it. A local part is a person's identity, every question this
check asks is about the zone, and the way to keep a promise about not holding
something is to have nowhere for it to go.

### What it cannot see


One standing limit, on every mail report: no message was sent. Where an
exchanger was contacted, the conversation ended once encryption had been
negotiated or declined, and no sender, recipient or message was named. A DANE
binding's correctness was not checked. And a DKIM key is read
only under a selector the scan was told to look under, because selectors cannot
be listed from DNS; the report names every selector it tried, and a report
saying DKIM was missing would be claiming something the scan did not establish
(R4).

This limit said "everything here was read from DNS" until the MTA-STS policy
could be fetched, and that sentence had to go rather than be reworded. A
standing limit is the same sentence on every report, and whether the policy is
read now differs by deployment; what this particular scan read about the policy
is said by the report that read it.

## `denyfirst-tls-v6` → `porch-tls-v7`

Released in v0.16.0, 2026-09.

**Three sentences corrected by the 2026-09-16 audit (A19, A20).** The coverage
line says every suite *this client can offer* was tried, not every suite the
server accepts. A verified transparency receipt is described as a log's signed
promise, with the inclusion proof named as not asked for, rather than as proof
the log recorded the certificate. And a version served the same leaf over a
different intermediate is now a different chain, graded like any other; it was
invisible before. The `alpn` field, which no handshake here ever filled, is
gone.

**A revocation list answers only for what it covers.** A delta list, a list
with a critical extension this does not read, and a list whose issuing
distribution point leaves this certificate out are now "not checked" instead of
"not revoked". No rule changed; `cert.revoked` is raised exactly as before.

**A scan whose suite list did not finish is ungraded, even beside a sound
certificate.** The transport was already ungraded when enumeration stopped
early; joining it with a strong certificate made the whole report strong. It
now stays ungraded unless something seen was worse.

**On Windows and macOS, "trusted" is decided by the carried copy of the
platform's store.** A system pool on those two platforms made crypto/x509 ask
the platform verifier, and Windows's fetches the intermediates a scanned
certificate names — outside the dialler that refuses private addresses. The
verdict there now rests on the copy of Microsoft's or Apple's store this build
carries, verified by crypto/x509 alone. A chain the platform used to complete by
fetching an intermediate the server never sent is now reported as incomplete or
untrusted, which is what the server sent. No rule changed; on Linux nothing
moved.

**Four clients' root stores are named beside the verdict.** The verdict on a
chain still rests on the store of the machine that ran the scan (R7). Beside it,
a report now says what Mozilla, Chrome, Microsoft and Apple make of the chain,
from copies of their stores carried in `internal/rootstores` and dated in the
report: trusted, conditionally trusted, distrusted for certificates issued after
a date, or not trusted. Only membership and Mozilla's TLS distrust dates are
evaluated; Chrome's version-dependent constraints and Microsoft's "NotBefore"
roots are reported as conditional rather than guessed at. **No verdict moved:**
which clients matter is the operator's to decide (R21). The sources are not
signed by their publishers; a refresh refuses any certificate that does not hash
to the fingerprint its publisher lists, and a weekly workflow opens an issue when
a store changes.

**Transparency receipts are now checked, not only counted.** Each receipt a
certificate or handshake carries is checked against the key Chrome's log list
gives its log, offline. The list is Google's published file, carried byte for
byte in `internal/ctlogs` and believed only when Google's signature over it
verifies against a key written into the source. A report names the list's
date and version, says how many signatures verified, and keeps apart a
signature that fails, a log the list does not name, and a receipt that could
not be checked. **No verdict moved:** transparency is described, never graded,
because how many receipts a certificate needs is each browser's policy (R21).
A weekly workflow opens an issue when the published logs change; a person
refreshes the list with `go run ./internal/ctlogs/refresh` and signs the commit.

**SSL 3.0, the export-grade suites and the NULL suites are now asked about.**
The rules `version.ssl3`, `cipher.export` and `cipher.null` existed in every
version and could not fire: this scanner measured through Go's TLS client, which
implements none of them, so a server still accepting SSL 3.0 was reported as
refusing every version and graded nothing. That was the flattering direction on
exactly the servers that most need the finding. A server accepting any of them
now comes back `insecure`. Nothing about such a server moved; its acceptance
became visible. No rule identifier and no verdict changed.

Each is one hand-written ClientHello: SSL 3.0 offering the suites a server of
that era would choose among, and a TLS 1.2 hello offering every export suite
and, separately, every NULL suite. No handshake is completed, no certificate is
read, and at most seventy-eight bytes of the reply are parsed. What is
established is whether *any* of each is accepted, not every one that is, and
the standing limit says so.

Only an alert is a refusal. A server that closes the connection instead is
reported as not measured, because a firewall does the same thing and neither is
the server declining (R4). And the hellos are sent only where an ordinary
handshake was answered: a name that did not resolve costs nobody four more
connections.

**Whether a downgraded hello is refused is reported, and not graded.** Where a
server accepts more than one version, a hello claiming the older one and
carrying `TLS_FALLBACK_SCSV` is sent. RFC 7507 asks a server that speaks
something newer to refuse it. Whether it did is described; no verdict moves,
because what a downgrade costs depends on the version it lands on, and that
version is graded on its own.

**The certificate's own responder can be asked, from the command line.**
`porch-scan -ask-responder`, off by default, posts the OCSP question to the
responder the certificate names and verifies the answer against the issuer. A
verified revoked raises `cert.revoked` and a verified unknown raises
`cert.revocation-unknown`, once each whatever else said the same; no rule
identifier and no verdict of any other kind changed. Without the flag nothing
is asked and every report reads as before. The service and the demonstration
never ask (R3a).

**Finite-field DHE and anonymous suites are now asked about.** Go's client
implements no suite of either family, so the ordinary enumeration could never
list one, and `cipher.ffdhe` and `cipher.anonymous` could not fire. A server
accepting `TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256` beside modern suites was
reported strong — and RFC 10015 now says a TLS 1.2 server MUST NOT select it.
Each family is one more hand-written hello offering only its own suites, from
the IANA registry, alongside the export and NULL ones; a server accepting any
comes back `insecure`. Nothing about such a server moved; its acceptance became
visible. No rule identifier changed, and as for the others, what is established
is whether any of each is accepted, not every one that is.

**The TLS 1.3 suites are now asked one at a time.** Go's client offers the TLS
1.3 suites it chooses and no others, so a TLS 1.3 server was listed with the
one suite it negotiated. A server also accepting AES-CCM, the ShangMi suites or
the integrity-only suites of RFC 9150 — which send every record in the clear —
was never asked about them, and one accepting `TLS_SHA256_SHA256` was reported
as strong. Each suite in the registry is now asked alone with a hand-written
hello, and a server accepting an integrity-only suite comes back `insecure`
under `cipher.no-encryption`, a rule that existed and could not fire. Nothing
about such a server moved; its acceptance became visible. No rule identifier
changed.

The answers are believed only when calibrated: the suite Go's own handshake
negotiated is asked too, and unless it comes back accepted at TLS 1.3 none of
the answers is used, only the negotiated suite is listed as before, and the
report says why. A suite nobody answered about leaves the list incomplete, which
leaves the verdict ungraded rather than strong, exactly as an incomplete TLS 1.2
list does (R4).

**A revocation list can now raise the `cert.revoked` finding.** Until this version a
certificate was reported as revoked only when the server stapled a status
response that verified against the issuing authority and said so. That path has
been drying up: the CA/Browser Forum made OCSP optional and revocation lists
mandatory, and authorities issuing for much of the web stopped publishing OCSP
altogether. A certificate from one of them names no responder, so nothing can be
stapled, so revocation went unestablished for most of the internet — and *not
established* is what a report honestly said.

The rule identifier is unchanged and its verdict is unchanged. What changed is
that a second source can reach it, so a server whose certificate was withdrawn,
and which was previously graded on everything else, can now come back
`insecure`. Nothing about such a server moved; what moved is that the withdrawal
became visible.

One withdrawal is still one finding. A server that staples a revoked response
*and* names a list that agrees raises `cert.revoked` once.

A list is believed only after it is fetched from an address the certificate
names, parsed under a size cap, verified against the issuing certificate, and
found to be inside its own validity window. Anything short of all four leaves
revocation unestablished, and the report says which of them failed — a list that
could not be checked is not a certificate that is not revoked.

**The demonstration deployment does not do this.** It promises on its privacy
page that it asks no certificate authority anything, and the promise is kept by
the call being compiled out of that build rather than by a default somebody
could change. A report from denyfirst.dev is graded by the same rule set and
says revocation was not checked, which is true there.

## `denyfirst-web-v2` → `porch-web-v3`

Released in v0.16.0, 2026-09.

**Four readings corrected by the 2026-09-16 audit (A13–A16).** A
Strict-Transport-Security header that repeats a directive is unparseable, as a
browser treats it, rather than read by its first `max-age`. Only a policy the
graded host sent itself is graded as its policy; another host's, reached by a
redirect, is not. A redirect this scan did not follow — a host the deployment
may not reach, or the redirect limit — is said as not followed rather than
graded `reach.never-reaches-tls`, and a site whose reach was not established is
ungraded rather than strong. And missing framing protection is said unless an
enforcing header carries `frame-ancestors`. No rule identifier changed.

**The page is read as a browser resolves its addresses (A17).** Character
references in attributes are decoded, `<base href>`, `srcset` and `formaction`
are read, `rel` is a list of words, and tabs, newlines and backslashes in an
address are read as the URL standard reads them. So `http&#58;//host/app.js`
is now the plaintext script it is, and can raise `content.mixed-blocked`. The
page's own host over plaintext or on another port is another origin. A read that
stopped part way now says so, as a truncated one did. The sentence naming
origins that carry an integrity attribute now says the hashes themselves were
not checked.

**The check reads the cookies it was already collecting.** Every Set-Cookie a
site sends has been in the report since the check shipped and no rule looked at
any of them. Four rules are added and three observations, and the line between
those two lists is the whole of the change worth arguing about.

### What is graded, and why only this

A browser settles each of these. They are not opinions about configuration;
they are what happens next, and a site that has one is usually the last to
know, because every symptom appears somewhere other than the header.

| rule | what a browser does |
|---|---|
| `cookie.no-secure-over-tls` | sends the cookie on plaintext requests too, in the clear |
| `cookie.host-prefix-broken` | rejects a `__Host-` cookie that breaks the prefix, entirely |
| `cookie.secure-prefix-broken` | rejects a `__Secure-` cookie sent without `Secure` |
| `cookie.samesite-none-without-secure` | rejects the cookie |

Three of the four mean a cookie the site believes it set does not exist.

### What is reported and deliberately not graded

There is a large body of advice about cookies and almost none of it is a line
anybody published. R21 is the rule being applied.

**`HttpOnly` missing** is good advice and not a rule. A CSRF token, a locale, a
consent flag and a feature switch are all cookies a page is meant to read, and
this check cannot tell which it is looking at — deliberately, since a cookie
value is never recorded. Failing those servers would be this project inventing
a threshold nobody can argue with.

**`SameSite` missing** is treated as `Lax` by current browsers. That is a
property of the browser rather than of the server, so it is stated rather than
graded.

**A `Domain` attribute** widens a cookie beyond the host that set it. That is
often deliberate, and it is reported because it decides how far a cookie
travels.

### The response headers are read too

The probe has collected thirteen headers since the check shipped and two of
them were read. The rest are read now, and almost all of them are reported
rather than graded.

One rule is added. `headers.cors-wildcard-with-credentials` fires where
`Access-Control-Allow-Origin` is `*` and `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials` is
`true`: a browser refuses that combination rather than choosing between them,
so the sharing the site configured does not work and nothing about the
response says so.

Everything else is a sentence. The headers a response did not send are listed
once, with what each one does, because that is the list somebody closing gaps
works from — and none of them is required by any specification. A missing
`X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` is on that list, and it is the one worth
explaining: it was written as a graded finding first, and an existing test
caught it by refusing to call a correctly reached site `strong`. There is no
arrangement that wants nosniff absent, which is a good argument for grading it
and not the same as a consequence this scan establishes — whether the absence
matters depends on content types nothing here read. `hsts.absent` is graded
because its consequence follows from the scan alone.

A site sending a `Content-Security-Policy` header with `frame-ancestors` is not
told it lacks `X-Frame-Options`, which that directive replaced. A policy without
the directive, or one declared only in the page, was taken as the same until
the 2026-09-16 audit (A16); CSP Level 3 has a browser ignore `frame-ancestors`
in a meta element, so the missing header is said there.

### The page itself is read, where the deployment reads pages

**This is a change to a published promise and it is the most consequential
thing in this version.** Until now the check read response headers and closed
the body unread, and said so on `/web/method` and in `docs/invariants.md`. It
now reads the final HTML response — once, to a bound of one megabyte, streamed
— and keeps nothing of it.

The reason for reading it: a `Content-Security-Policy` declared with `<meta
http-equiv>` is one a browser applies and a header check cannot see, so a site
that had done the work was told it had no policy, and then told a second time
that it was missing framing protection the policy supersedes. One omission, two
wrong sentences, both about something already done. That is fixed here.

The reason nothing is kept: a body holds a key in a comment, a token in a
script, a name in a template, and a report is a thing people paste into issue
trackers. So what survives a read is a handful of booleans and a bounded list
of **host names** — a reference is reduced to its host before it is kept, with
no path, no query, and userinfo dropped first, because `http://user:token@host/`
in somebody's markup is a credential.

Which deployment read your page is now part of the promise. The user agent
names one address from every installation, so `/web/method` describes both: the
demonstration reads no body at all, and an installation somebody runs
themselves may have read the page. A flat sentence there would have been true
of one and false of the one in a log reader's records.

Two standing limits are reworded, and both were wrong in the direction that
matters.

`web-root-only` said **"Only the root was asked, and only its headers were
read"** and now says **"Only the root was asked"**. The second half stopped
being true of every deployment, and a standing limit is one sentence on every
report — so the half that is always true stays, and what a particular scan read
is said by the report that read it.

`web-no-browser` said what a page actually loads **"is visible only to a
browser executing the page"**. What a page *declares* it loads is read now, so
that sentence disowned a finding the same report had just made. It says what is
still true instead: nothing was executed, so anything a script fetches once it
runs was not seen.

### Two rules that rest on the page

| rule | verdict | when |
|---|---|---|
| `content.form-posts-in-the-clear` | insecure | a form on a secure page has an `http://` action |
| `content.mixed-blocked` | weak | a secure page loads a script, stylesheet, frame or plugin resource over `http://` |

Both rest on the W3C Mixed Content specification, which does not advise: it
divides plaintext subresources on a secure page into *blockable* and
*optionally-blockable* and says what a user agent does with each. Blockable
content is refused by every current browser, so the resource does not arrive
and the page runs without it — a page broken in a way its author may not have
seen, because a blocked subresource fails quietly. A form is neither: a browser
submits it, so whatever a visitor types travels in the clear, which is the one
rule here about the visitor rather than the page.

**Optionally-blockable content — images and media — is reported and not
graded.** Browsers upgrade some, block others, and do not all agree. A verdict
would be this project deciding something a standards body deliberately left
open (R21), and it would land on a site whose behaviour depends on which
browser the visitor uses.

**Two more things the page shows, both reported and never graded.**

`content` has no rule for either, because neither is an error any document
declares. What they have instead is a sentence naming the origins, which is the
part an operator cannot get any other way.

**Code from another origin with no `integrity` attribute.** A browser executes
whatever that origin sends, with the page's own authority, and checks nothing
about it. Subresource integrity makes the browser refuse anything that is not
the exact file expected. No specification requires one, and pinning has a real
cost — a provider shipping a fix breaks every page pinned to the version before
it — so this is named rather than graded (R21). Where a site has pinned some
already, the report says so beside the gaps: a list of gaps with no denominator
reads as a site that has never heard of the attribute.

Scheme-relative addresses are read here, not skipped. `//cdn.example/jquery.js`
inherits the page's scheme, so it is never mixed content — and it is how a
great many older pages load their scripts, which are exactly the pages least
likely to carry a hash.

**A form posting to another origin over TLS.** Ordinary and often correct: a
payment processor or a search provider looks exactly like this. It is named
because a visitor sees this page's address while typing into somebody else's
form, and because whoever runs the site is the only person who can say which are
meant. Kept apart from `content.form-posts-in-the-clear`, which is graded and is
a different fact.

**Origin means host, not registrable domain.** `static.example.com` is a
different origin from `www.example.com`, and subresource integrity and CORS both
work on origins. Folding siblings together would report a site as loading
nothing from elsewhere while a browser treats it as exactly that.

### What can move a verdict

A site can now be graded `weak` by `content.mixed-blocked` or `insecure` by
`content.form-posts-in-the-clear` where it was not graded before. **Nothing
about such a site changed**: what changed is that the page is read, so what was
already in it became visible. Both are only reachable on a deployment that
reads bodies, so a report from the public demonstration cannot carry either.

A verdict can also move the other way, and this one is a correction: a site
declaring its policy in markup is no longer listed as sending no
`Content-Security-Policy` and no longer told it lacks `X-Frame-Options`. Those
were notes rather than findings, so no verdict changes from that alone.

### Nothing else moved

No reach, HSTS or cookie rule was added, removed, or made stricter. A site with
no cookies, every header in place and nothing loaded over plaintext is graded
exactly as it was under v2.

---

## `denyfirst-web-v1` → `denyfirst-web-v2`

Released in v0.16.0, 2026-09, already superseded there by `porch-web-v3`. It
was tagged as v0.15.1, which was built and never signed or published, so no
published release graded under v2; the section stays because v3 is described
as a change from it.

**Two verdicts change, in the same direction and for the same reason: v1 said
nothing where it had measured something.** No rule was added, removed, or made
stricter, and no site that was reported as having a problem stops having one.

### A correctly reached site is now `strong`, not `ungraded`

`ungraded` means *nothing was established*. It is what a host that never
answered comes back as, and it exists so that silence about something untested
cannot read as approval.

A site whose plaintext address redirects straight to TLS, or answers nothing at
all, and whose policy is sound, has had a great deal established about it. v1
reported that as an absence, which made a correct site indistinguishable from
an unreachable one — and on the command line, where the exit status is the
whole product, they were the same number: `4`.

| | v1 | v2 |
|---|---|---|
| sound arrangement, sound policy | `ungraded`, exit 4 | `strong`, exit 0 |
| nothing answered over TLS | `ungraded`, exit 4 | `ungraded`, exit 4 |

If you gated a pipeline on `denyfirst-scan -check web` under v0.15.0, it failed
on every host that passed. That is the defect, and this is the fix.

### A host that answered nothing is no longer graded for its policy

v1 read the `Strict-Transport-Security` headers of the secure chain, found an
empty list, and raised `hsts.absent`: **weak, no policy tells a browser to come
back over TLS.** A host that answered without the header and a host that
answered nothing at all both produce an empty list, and v1 could not tell them
apart, so it made a claim about a server it had never spoken to.

`GradeHSTS` is now told whether any response arrived over TLS. Where none did,
the report says so as something not established, and raises nothing.

That is R17 — *a finding claims what was measured, not what it implies* — and
R4 — *nothing measured is not the same as passing, or as failing*. Both were
already written down. Neither was applied to the rule set added the day before.

### Nothing else moved

The ten rule identifiers are unchanged, and so is every verdict they produce.
Anything tracking or suppressing a finding by its identifier is unaffected.
`denyfirst-tls-v6` is untouched.

---

## `denyfirst-web-v1` — a new rule set

Released in v0.15.0, 2026-09.

A second rule set, for a second check: how a name answers on each scheme, and
what it says about coming back over TLS. **No TLS verdict changed and no TLS
rule moved.** `denyfirst-tls-v6` grades a handshake and a certificate;
`denyfirst-web-v1` grades an HTTP response, which most of the ports this
project scans do not have. A report carries the rule set that graded it, and
these two are never the same one.

The check exists because a TLS report can be entirely correct and still leave
its reader with the wrong impression. A host can negotiate TLS 1.3 with an
immaculate certificate while serving the same site in the clear on port 80 and
declaring no policy at all — and every visitor who types the name without a
scheme hands their first request to whoever is on the path. Nothing in a TLS
report says so, because nothing in a handshake shows it.

### What it grades

| rule | verdict | when |
|---|---|---|
| `reach.plaintext-served` | insecure | port 80 returns a page instead of redirecting |
| `reach.never-reaches-tls` | insecure | the redirects from port 80 end while still on plaintext |
| `reach.downgrades-to-plaintext` | insecure | the https address ends on an http one |
| `reach.plaintext-not-redirected` | weak | port 80 answers, and does not send the visitor to TLS |
| `reach.redirect-via-plaintext` | weak | TLS is reached, but only after a second cleartext request |
| `hsts.absent` | weak | no `Strict-Transport-Security` on the secure response |
| `hsts.plaintext-only` | weak | the header is sent only where RFC 6797 requires a browser to ignore it |
| `hsts.unparseable` | weak | the header has no `max-age` a browser can read, so the whole header is discarded |
| `hsts.disabled` | weak | `max-age=0`, which tells a browser to forget the policy |
| `hsts.preload-ineffective` | weak | `preload` is requested without the year and `includeSubDomains` the list requires |

### What it deliberately does not grade

**The length of `max-age`.** No standards body publishes a minimum, and
OWASP's cheat sheet explicitly recommends a short one during a rollout. A rule
failing anything under a year would be this project inventing a threshold and
then reporting a deliberate, correct choice as a fault. The value is described
instead — in years or days, with what a browser does when it lapses — and the
one-year figure appears only as what it is: the bar for one browser
programme's list.

**The absence of `includeSubDomains`.** A host with nothing beneath it needs
no subdomain clause, and a scan of one host cannot see what is beneath it.

**A temporary redirect from plaintext.** A 302 to the secure address works. It
is described, because a browser may repeat the cleartext request where a
permanent one would not, but it is not a fault on its own.

Three of the four checks this project has now declined to invent a threshold
for. That is the intended direction: a verdict rests on a document somebody
can read, and where no document exists the measurement is reported rather than
graded.

### `policy.Version` is now `policy.TLSVersion`

An identifier, not a value. `policy.Version` beside `policy.WebVersion` reads
as *the* version and the web one, which is the confusion renaming the value to
`denyfirst-tls-v6` was meant to end. Nothing a report says changed.

---

## `denyfirst-v6` → `denyfirst-tls-v6`

Released in v0.13.0, 2026-09. **No rule changed.** A report graded
`denyfirst-v6` and a report graded `denyfirst-tls-v6` are comparable in every
respect: the same twenty-four certificate rules, the same chain grading, the
same cipher and protocol verdicts, from the same source. Only the name of the
rule set is different, and this section exists so that a reader who notices
the change does not go looking for the rules behind it.

The name now carries the check as well as the number. This project has one
check and expects more — the first of them looks at how a domain publishes its
mail policy — and a number on its own stops meaning one thing the moment there
is a second rule set. `denyfirst-v7` over a mail report and `denyfirst-v7`
over a TLS report would be the same name over two different rule sets, which
is precisely the confusion the name is printed to prevent.

Renamed while there is one rule set to rename, for the same reason the check
moved to its own address in the same release: it costs nothing today and
cannot be undone cheaply once reports carrying the ambiguous name are in
somebody's pipeline.

Nothing else about a report changed. The rule identifiers are unchanged, so
anything tracking or suppressing a finding by its identifier is unaffected.

---

## `denyfirst-v5` → `denyfirst-v6`

Released in v0.11.0, 2026-09. **The rest of the chain is graded.** Until now
all twenty-four certificate rules looked at the certificate served for the
host and at nothing else: the chain was checked for trust — does it reach a
root — and never for strength. A report said

```
Chain   4 certificates, trusted
```

beside a `strong` verdict, and three of those four had been graded by nothing.
An intermediate signed with SHA-1, or holding a 1024-bit key, passed in
silence.

It matters more on an issuer than on a leaf. **A forged leaf impersonates the
names inside it; a forged intermediate issues certificates for any name at
all**, and every client that trusts the chain accepts them. That is the
argument `cert.leaf-is-ca` rests on, arriving from the other direction.

Nothing new is asked of the server. These are bytes the handshake already
delivered.

### Rules added

| Rule | Verdict | When |
|---|---|---|
| `chain.signature-sha1` | Insecure | An issuer carries a SHA-1 signature |
| `chain.signature-md5` | Insecure | An issuer carries an MD5 or MD2 signature |
| `chain.signature-algorithm-unrecognised` | Weak | An issuer's signature algorithm is not one this rule set knows |
| `chain.roca` | Insecure | An issuer's RSA modulus carries the RSALib fingerprint |
| `chain.rsa-key-too-small` | Insecure | An issuer holds an RSA key below 2048 bits |
| `chain.ec-key-too-small` | Insecure | An issuer holds a curve below P-256 |
| `chain.key-algorithm-unrecognised` | Weak | An issuer's key type cannot be sized by this rule set |
| `chain.expired` | Insecure | An issuer's validity has ended |
| `chain.not-yet-valid` | Insecure | An issuer's validity has not begun |
| `chain.expiring-soon` | Weak | An issuer expires within 30 days |
| `chain.critical-extension-unrecognised` | Weak | An issuer marks an extension critical that this checker does not recognise |

The identifiers are `chain.` and not `cert.` deliberately. A pipeline
filtering on `cert.signature-sha1` today would otherwise start receiving
findings about a different certificate under an identifier whose meaning it
had already fixed. A new identifier is additive; a widened one is a silent
change.

### What is deliberately not graded

**Names.** A wildcard shape, a missing subject alternative name, a common name
outside the SAN list are questions about a certificate presented *for a name*.
An issuer is not presented for one.

**Self-signature.** A root is self-signed; that is what a root is, and
`cert.self-signed` would fire on every complete chain.

**Validity length.** An authority is issued for ten or twenty years by design.
The leaf's limit would fire on every chain ever served.

**Being an authority, and holding `keyCertSign`.** On an issuer both are
required rather than suspect — the exact inverse of `cert.leaf-is-ca` and
`cert.key-usage-cert-sign`.

### And the root is not graded at all

A root is trusted because the client already holds a copy, **not** because of
the signature it carries. No client verifies that signature — one that did
would be asking a certificate to vouch for itself — so grading it would raise
an alarm about a risk nobody is exposed to, and roots predating SHA-256 are
still in every store doing no harm.

Any self-signed certificate in the chain is skipped, which is how a client
treats it too. Where the server sent one, the report says so and says why.

### What this means for a verdict

An insecure issuer makes the report insecure, by the same worst-case rule as
everything else: a chain is only as sound as the weakest certificate a client
has to accept to reach a root.

---

## `denyfirst-v4` → `denyfirst-v5`

Released in v0.8.0, 2026-09. Four rules, all of them read off a certificate
this scan already had, so nothing new is asked of the server: the same
handshakes, the same bytes, the same load at the other end.

All four grade something the report was **already displaying and grading with
nothing**. A reader saw `CA: true` beside a leaf certificate and found no
finding next to it.

### What a certificate says it may be

| Rule | Verdict | When |
|---|---|---|
| `cert.leaf-is-ca` | Insecure | Basic constraints say `cA:TRUE` on the certificate served for this host |
| `cert.key-usage-cert-sign` | Insecure | The key usage includes `keyCertSign` and basic constraints do not say `cA:TRUE` |

**`cert.leaf-is-ca`.** RFC 5280 does not forbid it and Go's verifier accepts
such a certificate for a hostname, so nothing else on a report catches it. The
Baseline Requirements do forbid it — a subscriber certificate must carry
`cA:FALSE` — and the reason is the size of what the key can do. A stolen leaf
key normally impersonates the names in that leaf. A stolen leaf key that may
sign issues certificates **for any name at all**, and every client that trusts
the chain accepts them.

Absent is not false. With no basic constraints extension the question was not
answered, and reading *not a CA* out of silence would be drawing a measurement
that did not happen.

**`cert.key-usage-cert-sign`.** The same power arriving by the other
extension. RFC 5280 permits `keyCertSign` only where basic constraints say
`cA:TRUE`, so a certificate carrying one without the other claims a power its
own constraints deny it, and clients disagree about which half to believe. Not
raised where `cA:TRUE` is also present: that is the rule above, and charging
one mistake twice reports it as two.

### What a certificate says its key may do

| Rule | Verdict | When |
|---|---|---|
| `cert.no-digital-signature` | Weak | The key usage lists purposes and `digitalSignature` is not among them |
| `cert.critical-extension-unrecognised` | Weak | The certificate marks an extension critical that this checker does not recognise |

**`cert.no-digital-signature`.** Every TLS 1.3 handshake and every ECDHE
handshake at TLS 1.2 has the server sign with its key, so a client enforcing
the extension can use neither. An absent extension means *any purpose* and is
not this case, exactly as with the extended key usage in v4.

**`cert.critical-extension-unrecognised`.** RFC 5280 requires a client that
meets a critical extension it does not recognise to reject the certificate.
Go's verifier does, so such a certificate already produced
`cert.chain-untrusted` — **with no reason attached**. The finding names the
extension by object identifier and says only what was established: that this
checker does not recognise it. Whether the clients an operator cares about
recognise it is not something a scan from here can see.

### What did not change

No existing rule changed meaning. Every verdict that moves under `v5` moves
because of something the certificate says about itself that `v4` displayed and
did not grade.

---

## `denyfirst-v3` → `denyfirst-v4`

Released in v0.4.0, 2026-08. Five rules added and three notes. Every one of
them is read off a certificate this scan already had, so nothing new is asked
of the server: the same handshakes, the same bytes, the same load at the other
end.

### A key made by a generator known to be broken

| Rule | Verdict | When |
|---|---|---|
| `cert.roca` | Insecure | The RSA modulus carries the fingerprint of Infineon's RSALib, CVE-2017-15361 |

RSALib built primes of the form `k·M + (65537^a mod M)`, with `M` the product
of the first *n* primes, instead of choosing them at random. Both primes of a
key were made that way, so the modulus satisfies `N ≡ 65537^(a+b) (mod M)` —
and a key of that shape can be factored from the public key alone by
Coppersmith's method, in weeks to months of computation, with no access to the
server. Millions of smart cards, TPMs and national identity cards were
affected in 2017; Estonia withdrew over 750,000 identity cards.

**Nothing here factors anything.** Detection is a residue test: by the Chinese
remainder theorem, `N mod p` must lie in the subgroup 65537 generates for every
prime `p` dividing `M`, and checking thirty-eight of those takes microseconds.
So the finding says what was established — that the key carries the fingerprint
of a generator known to produce factorable keys — and not what it implies. The
two are different claims, and only the first one was measured.

The test is a necessary condition rather than a sufficient one: a modulus with
no relation to RSALib would have to land inside the reachable set modulo all
thirty-eight primes at once. The published corpora report no false positives,
and the wording is chosen so that the report is still true if one exists.

Nothing about a report changes for a key from any other generator. Practically
every publicly trusted certificate carrying this shape was revoked in 2017, and
authorities have been required to refuse such keys since; where it still bites
is keys generated on a smart card or a TPM for a server somebody runs
themselves, which is exactly what this project expects to be pointed at.

### What the certificate says it is for, and about whom

| Rule | Verdict | When |
|---|---|---|
| `cert.no-server-auth` | Insecure | The extended key usage extension lists purposes and server authentication is not among them |
| `cert.wildcard-shape` | Weak | A name contains `*` somewhere other than as the whole of the leftmost label |
| `cert.cn-not-in-san` | Weak | The common name holds a hostname that the subject alternative name does not |
| `cert.serial-entropy` | Weak | On a publicly trusted chain, a serial number too small to hold the required randomness |

**`cert.no-server-auth`.** RFC 5280 makes the extended key usage list
exhaustive, so a certificate listing purposes and omitting server
authentication is a certificate for something else, and a client following the
document refuses the connection however correct the rest is. An absent
extension means *any purpose* and is not this case — absent is not the same as
excluding, and older certificates commonly carry none.

**`cert.wildcard-shape`.** RFC 9525 permits one form: a leftmost label that is
exactly `*`. `w*.example.com`, `a.*.example.com`, `*.*.example.com` and a bare
`*` were each matched by some client at some point and are matched by none now.
A name in one of those shapes is worse than a missing one, because whoever
issued it believes the host is covered.

**`cert.cn-not-in-san`.** Clients have matched names from the subject
alternative name and nowhere else since RFC 2818 was replaced, and the Baseline
Requirements say the common name, if present, must repeat one of those values
rather than add one. So a hostname there that is not in the extension is
matched by nothing while telling a reader the certificate covers it. Only
raised when the common name is trying to be a hostname: an authority's own
label, `R11`, and an organisation name are not accused of being one.

**`cert.serial-entropy`, and why the threshold is not 64.** The Baseline
Requirements have required at least 64 bits from a random source since 2016,
because a predictable serial lets an attacker who can influence a certificate's
contents mount a hash collision against its signature. But a serial carrying 64
bits of that output is uniform over `[0, 2^64)`, so its *value* has fewer than
64 bits half the time and fewer than 63 a quarter of the time: a rule demanding
64 would accuse half of every compliant certificate ever issued. What one
certificate can honestly show is that a serial is far too small to hold that
output at all — a compliant one lands below `2^32` about once in four thousand
million — so that is what this rule says, and it catches counters and sequences
rather than pretending to measure entropy. It is raised only for a chain that
reaches the trust store, because the requirement is the Forum's and a private
authority answers to whoever runs it.

### Two notes, which are not verdicts

A **small RSA public exponent** is reported when it is below 65537. The
Baseline Requirements say the exponent *should* be at least that, not that it
must, and inventing a verdict the document does not carry is how a rule set
stops being checkable against the document it claims to follow.

**How many names a certificate covers** is reported whenever it is more than
one, with a sentence about shared certificates once it passes twenty. One key
standing behind a hundred hosts is a fact about the arrangement rather than a
fault in it, and it is the fact that decides what a stolen key costs.

### One more note, and the only measurement that costs a handshake

Whether the server will negotiate **X25519MLKEM768**, a hybrid of X25519 and
ML-KEM-768, is now reported on a `Key exchange` line beside the cipher suites.

It is the reason to care about a key exchange at all in 2026: traffic recorded
today can be kept and decrypted by whoever first builds a quantum computer
large enough, which is why the attack is called *harvest now, decrypt later*.
Forward secrecy does not prevent it — that protects against a private key
stolen afterwards, not against the exchange itself being broken.

Reported and not graded, because no document this rule set follows requires a
hybrid yet, and a verdict invented here would be this project grading against
its own opinion.

Three answers, not two: accepted, declined, and not established. The hybrid is
defined for TLS 1.3 alone, so a server without it is never asked and the
report says so rather than reading the silence as a refusal.

**It costs the scanned server one extra handshake, and only where the question
exists.** Measured on a synthetic server: a full scan of a modern host went
from twelve connections to thirteen, and a TLS 1.2 server stayed at twelve.

### The report says which of three things a note is

No rule changed here, and no verdict. What changed is how a report is read.

Everything that is not a finding used to appear under one heading, *What this
did not measure*. Three kinds of sentence lived there: what the scan
established and does not grade, what it could not settle about the host in
front of it, and what this program never claims about any host. A scan of a
bank on 2026-09-01 put eleven sentences under that heading, of which three
were limits of the scan. Among the rest was a post-quantum key exchange that
had been measured and passed.

Notes now carry a kind, and the report has three sections: **Observed**, **Not
established for this host**, and **Limits of this method**.

**This changes the API.** `notes` was an array of strings; it is now an array
of `{"kind": "...", "text": "..."}`, and the same applies to the `notes` of
each component. Anything reading the field will need the `.text`. It is a
breaking change, made one day after the field first shipped in v0.4.0 and
recorded here rather than left for a reader to discover.

### A CAA record set reads the same twice

RFC 8659 gives `issue` and `issuewild` properties no ordering and no
precedence, and a resolver returns them in whatever order it likes. Two scans
of paypal.com a quarter of an hour apart named the same authorities in
different orders, and so did cloudflare.com and kapitalbank.az.

They are sorted now, in the facts as well as in the sentence, so a report on
an unchanged server does not move between scans. A diff full of changes that
did not happen is one where the change that did happen is lost.

### A report says how much of it was reached

A report described only rules unbroken and absences observed. On a `strong`
result the strongest sentence available was *Nothing here fell short of the
rules*, and four of five observations beside it named something the server
does not do.

v0.6.x answered that with a block of nine affirmative sentences. Read on the
live site, seven of the nine restated a table or a certificate row that was
already on the page — one of them word for word. The block is gone. What
replaces it is one line beside the verdict:

```
Coverage  Every cipher suite this client can offer was tried, the chain was
          checked against the trust store, revocation was read from a stapled
          response, transparency receipts were counted, and issuance policy
          was answered.
```

It says what the scan reached and never what it missed — gaps belong to **Not
established for this host**, once. It carries no marks and no colour: green
ticks beside an insecure verdict read as approval, and a red mark against a
name with no CAA record would be a grade this rule set deliberately does not
give.

A clause appears only when that thing was read, so a scan that reached nothing
says nothing.

### A verdict says what it means

Beside a weak or insecure stamp:

> Worst case: an attacker chooses which option to negotiate, so the weakest
> one a server accepts is the one that decides.

A server can be graded insecure with a trusted chain, a verified staple,
transparency, CAA and an accepted post-quantum group, and until now nothing on
the report said why one option outweighed the rest.

### Cipher order and key exchange are labelled

Both sat under the cipher table as prose with nothing in front of them, and
the key exchange — the one measurement that costs the scanned server an extra
handshake — was being read on a second visit rather than a first. They are
rows now, in the same grammar as the certificate block, and they stay with the
suites: a key exchange is a property of the transport, and filing it under the
certificate teaches a reader that `RSA 4096` and `X25519MLKEM768` are the same
kind of thing.

### API

`assurances` is removed, one release after it was added, and replaced by
`coverage`: a single string, empty when a scan reached nothing.
`certificate.hostnameMatches` and `certificate.inDate` stay.

### The limits of the method are on one page### The limits of the method are on one page

Four of the sentences a report carried were true of every scan and said
nothing about the host: which cipher suites this client is able to offer, why
TLS 1.3 suites cannot be enumerated, that no certificate authority is ever
asked, and that transparency receipts are counted rather than verified.

They are no longer printed on each report. Reports name how many there are and
link **/method**, which explains how a report is read and lists all four; the
command line prints them with `denyfirst-scan -limits`, which needs no
network. They are declared once in `internal/policy/standing.go` and the page
is generated from that declaration, so the two cannot disagree.

### One sentence was wrong, on about a third of hosts

`Revocation was not checked` was appended to every report. It was written when
nothing here parsed a stapled response, and v0.3.0 — which taught this project
to read one and verify it against the issuer — did not remove it. So a server
that staples was told both that revocation had not been checked and that the
stapled response had been read and verified, one line above the other.

The sentence is gone. What replaces it says only what is true on every branch:
no certificate authority is asked anything by this scan, and revocation is read
only from a response the server stapled. What that response did or did not
establish is said where it is known.

### What did not change

No existing rule changed meaning and no verdict moved. A report from
`denyfirst-v3` and one from `denyfirst-v4` are comparable for every server
that keeps to the documents these rules cite — which is nearly all of them.

---

## `denyfirst-v2` → `denyfirst-v3`

Released in v0.3.0, 2026-08. One change, and it is the largest single change
this project has made to what a report means.

### The stapled response is now read

Until now this project observed that bytes arrived in the handshake and said
*a certificate status response was stapled*. It never parsed one. A server can
staple anything — an empty file, a year-old response, a response about a
different certificate, one signed by nobody, or one that says revoked — and
all of them produced the same sentence, which a reader takes to mean
revocation was checked.

The response is now parsed and has to pass every one of these before its
status is reported: the responder answered successfully with a basic response;
the entry describes **this** certificate by issuer name hash, issuer key hash
and serial number, all three; it was produced in the past and has not expired;
and it is signed by the issuer, or by a responder the issuer both signed and
marked with the OCSP-signing extended key usage.

| Rule | Verdict | When |
|---|---|---|
| `cert.revoked` | Insecure | A verified response says the certificate was withdrawn |
| `cert.revocation-unknown` | Weak | A verified response says the authority has no record of this serial. Not the same as *not revoked* |
| `cert.staple-unverifiable` | Weak | Bytes were stapled and establish nothing: malformed, expired, about another certificate, or unsigned |

`cert.must-staple-not-stapled` changed meaning. It fired only when no response
arrived, so a certificate demanding a staple and receiving sixteen bytes of
rubbish passed it. It now fires unless a response arrives **and verifies**,
which is what a client honouring RFC 7633 requires — for such a client an
unverifiable response and an absent one are the same outcome: the handshake
fails.

Two things deliberately did **not** change. A missing staple is still not
graded, for the reason at the top of `internal/policy/staple.go`: the
authority decides whether a response exists, and several no longer publish
OCSP at all. And a chain that omits the issuer produces no finding here —
nothing can be verified without it, `cert.chain-incomplete` already grades the
omission, and charging one mistake twice would report it as two.

### What is still not checked

The responder certificate's own revocation status. Checking it means fetching
another response over the network from an address the scanned party chooses,
and this scanner fetches nothing: it reads only bytes the server already sent.
RFC 6960 §4.2.2.2.1 lets an issuer waive the check, and responder certificates
are short-lived for the same reason.

---

## `denyfirst-v1` → `denyfirst-v2`

Released in v0.2.0, 2026-08.

### Suites that now grade worse

| Rule | Was | Is | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| `cipher.ffdhe` | *(no rule)* | Insecure | RFC 10015, July 2026, updates BCP 195: ephemeral finite-field Diffie-Hellman moved from SHOULD NOT to **MUST NOT** for (D)TLS 1.2. Static RSA and non-ephemeral FFDH moved with it. |
| `cipher.no-forward-secrecy` | *(no rule)* | Insecure | Static RSA, static DH and static ECDH key exchange. A recorded session is decrypted by anyone who later obtains the server's key. |
| `cipher.no-encryption` | *(no rule)* | Insecure | RFC 9150's `TLS_SHA256_SHA256` and `TLS_SHA384_SHA384` authenticate and do not encrypt. Graded `strong` before, because nothing in the rules had considered a suite with no cipher in it. |
| `cipher.unrecognised` | Strong | Weak | A suite whose key exchange this project cannot identify was graded as though it had passed. An unreadable answer is not a pass. |
| `cert.signature-algorithm-unrecognised` | Strong | Weak | The same rule for a signature algorithm with no name. |
| `cert.key-algorithm-unrecognised` | Strong | Weak | The same rule for a key algorithm with no name. The algorithm is named in the finding. |

### Verdicts that are now withheld rather than given

| Situation | Was | Is |
|---|---|---|
| Cipher enumeration stopped before the server ran out of suites | Strong | **Ungraded** |
| A certificate chain that is both expired and untrusted | reported *trusted* | reported **not trusted** |
| A CAA lookup that stopped before reaching the top of the tree | "no CAA found" | "the search stopped at *x*; not established either way" |

The first is the one to know about if you gate on this. A truncated list can
support *something weak is here* and cannot support *nothing weak is here*, and
`strong` is the verdict that claims an absence. The host decides when to stop
answering, so `ungraded` is a state the scanned party can choose — which is
why the command line now exits `4` for it rather than `0`.

The second was a real misreading: Go checks a certificate's dates before it
looks for an issuer, so `Expired` is what it returns for an expired
certificate whether or not anything would ever have vouched for it. Trust is
now re-asked at a moment the certificate was valid.

### Things now graded that were not looked at

- **A certificate served only at an older protocol version.** A server picks
  its certificate from what the client offered, so an old client can be handed
  a different one. Every version that completes a handshake is compared by its
  leaf's own bytes, and a chain that differs is graded in full. The worse of
  the two sets the verdict.
- **Extended key usages the Go standard library has no name for.** They were
  dropped from the report, which read as though the certificate carried
  nothing else.

### Documents cited

- RFC 8446 replaced by **RFC 9846**, which obsoletes it.
- **RFC 10015** added, for the finite-field and static key exchange rules.
- **RFC 9150** added, for the integrity-only suites.

## What did not change

Grading is still worst-case: one insecure option makes a configuration
insecure, however many strong options sit beside it, because an attacker
chooses which to negotiate.

Refusing an obsolete protocol version is still not graded. A server that
declines TLS 1.0 has done the right thing, and a finding attached to that
refusal would report a correct configuration as insecure.

Issuance policy is still reported and not graded. It comes from a resolver
rather than from the connection, and it describes a system the person who
configured the server often does not administer.
