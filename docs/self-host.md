# Running it yourself

This is the tool. The site is a demonstration of it.

Until 2026-09-03 anybody could point denyfirst.dev at any host on the internet
and that server opened the connections. It put this project in the worst
position available to it: ours was the address in the scanned party's logs,
and we had deliberately made ourselves unable to say who had asked, because
recording that is the one thing this project undertakes not to do. There were
two ways out — start keeping records, which is not available, or stop
connecting to third parties. This is the second.

So the scan runs on your machine, from your address, under your
responsibility. The public deployment reaches only hosts this project owns.

What that buys you is not only ours to give up.

**The promise becomes a fact.** The hosted service says it records nothing and
you have to believe it. Here there is nothing to believe: this project is not
in the path. *I don't even have the data to begin with* is a stronger
statement than any policy.

**The restrictions that exist for a public service do not apply to you.** They
are there so that a stranger cannot use somebody else's server through ours,
and you are not a stranger to your own network:

| | hosted | yours |
|---|---|---|
| private and loopback addresses | refused | `-allow-private` |
| ports | eight implicit-TLS ports | any |
| bare IP addresses | refused | accepted |
| which hosts | the ones this project owns | whichever you point it at |

### The last row is the one to read twice

`porchd` listens on `127.0.0.1:8080` by default, and on that address the row
above is exactly right: the only person who can reach it is you.

**Bind it to an interface a stranger can reach, without
`-verification-secret-file`, and you have built an open scanner.** Anyone who
can reach the port can point it at any public host on the internet, and it is
*your* address in that host's logs. That is the arrangement this project
dismantled for its own public deployment — see `docs/scope.md` — rebuilt inside
your network.

A default is a mitigation rather than a boundary: it is the thing somebody
changes on the afternoon they need the service reachable, without changing
anything else. The boundary is proof of control, it is one flag, and
`docs/verify.md` is how to set it up:

```sh
porchd -listen 0.0.0.0:8443 -verification-secret-file /etc/porch/secret
```

The file is created on the first start if it is not there. Without it, `porchd`
refuses to listen anywhere but loopback unless it is also given `-open`.

`porchd -version` says which of the two you have, so a deploy can read it
rather than trust a filename:

```
scans whatever it is pointed at              # no proof required
scans only domains it has been shown control of
```

This is written here rather than only in `docs/scope.md` because this is the
page somebody follows while setting the service up, and a warning they meet
after they have finished is a warning about something they have already done.

---

## Keeping your own results

Nothing is kept unless you say where to keep it. That is the default and it
does not change.

What changes on a machine you run yourself is whose data it is. The public
deployment holds nothing because it is the visible party in somebody else's
logs and cannot say who asked — a repository worth seizing. None of that
reasoning survives the move to your own machine: these are your scans, of your
own estate, because you asked for them.

```sh
porch-scan -results-dir /var/lib/porch/results denyfirst.dev
porch-scan -results-dir /var/lib/porch/results -history denyfirst.dev
```

```
denyfirst.dev
=============

  DATE         VERDICT    FINDINGS
  2026-08-14   weak       hsts.absent
  2026-09-12   strong     none

  All graded by porch-tls-v7
```

`porchd` takes the same two flags, for a service that runs on this machine's
loopback with no password — a schedule, say — and writes to the same store, so
it and a person at a terminal build one history rather than two.

**Behind a password, History is the history.** The compose file starts
`porchd` with `-access-file`, and then every report is kept whole and encrypted
under **History**, to open again or delete; see *One password, and what it
seals* below. `-results-dir` beside a password is refused at start, because it
would keep a second copy in the clear, under each checked name, of what the
password is there to seal.

**The plain store is never served over HTTP.** A browsable history of an
estate's weaknesses is a thing worth attacking, so a service with no password
does not offer one. Reading it back is `porch-scan -history`, which runs on
the machine, makes no connection and resolves nothing.

**Nothing is kept that a report does not already carry**: the date, the check,
the rule set, the verdict, and which rules were raised. No time of day, no
client address, no markup, no cookie value. Writing a report down does not
relax what a report may contain.

**The rule set is kept beside each verdict**, and `-history` says where in a
history it changed. A server that went from strong to weak because a rule got
stricter has not changed at all, and a table that showed those two rows side by
side without saying so would send somebody looking for a change that never
happened.

**No retention period is invented.** `-results-keep N` bounds a target's
history and drops the oldest first; unset keeps everything. A number this
project chose would be a threshold nobody can argue with, applied to your disk.

## Get a binary, and check it before you run it


Every release carries `SHA256SUMS` and an OpenSSH signature over it, and a
workflow rebuilds each release on a machine the maintainer does not control.

**[`docs/verify.md`](verify.md) has the procedure.** It is not repeated here,
because two copies of a verification procedure drift and the copy nobody is
reading is the one that goes wrong. Do that first; everything below assumes a
binary you have checked.

Building from source is the other answer, and needs nothing but Go:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/denyfirst/porch
cd porch
go build ./cmd/porch-scan ./cmd/porchd
```

`go.mod` has no `require` block. Nothing is fetched beyond the standard
library, so there is no third-party supply chain to audit here.

---

## The command line

```sh
./porch-scan example.com
./porch-scan -json example.com
./porch-scan -allow-private 10.0.0.5
```

The exit status is the worst verdict found — `0` strong, `1` weak, `2`
insecure, `3` the scan could not be completed — so it gates a pipeline without
anything having to parse the output.

### Four checks

`-check` selects which one runs, and the default is the one that has always
run. A default that quietly started running a second check would change the
exit status of a pipeline nobody touched.

```sh
./porch-scan example.com                 # the transport and its certificates
./porch-scan -check web example.com      # how the site is reached over HTTP
./porch-scan -check mail example.com     # what its DNS says about its mail
./porch-scan -check dns example.com      # how the domain itself is served
```

The DNS check connects to nothing at all: it asks the resolver for what the
domain publishes about itself — its addresses, its name servers and their
addresses, the record at the top of its zone, and the two ends of its DNSSEC
chain — and grades the few things a standard requires. Its own digest of the
zone's keys is compared with the one the parent holds, so a key rotated
without the registrar being told is found before a validating resolver finds
it for you.

### If the Issuance line says "not checked"

That row is the CAA record set: which authorities the domain allows to issue a
certificate for it. Reading it needs a resolver, and the resolver is this
machine's own — read from `/etc/resolv.conf` on unix, assembled from the
registry on Windows. Every one the machine has configured is tried in order,
because the second is there for exactly the case where the first does not
answer.

If it still says *not checked*, name one:

```sh
./porch-scan -resolver 192.168.1.1:53 example.com
```

Any resolver you would ordinarily use. There is deliberately no default: a
public resolver chosen by this program would quietly decide who learns which
names you are looking at, and that is your decision rather than ours.

The web check answers what a TLS report cannot: whether the site is *also*
served in the clear, whether the plaintext address sends a visitor to the
secure one, and whether anything tells a browser to come back over TLS. A host
can negotiate TLS 1.3 with an immaculate certificate and still hand every
visitor's first request to whoever is on the path.

It sends **one `GET` of `/`** over each scheme, reads the headers, closes the
body unread, and follows only the addresses a `Location` header names. It
never requests a path of its own choosing. `docs/invariants.md` N7 has the
whole discipline.

The four rule sets are separate and never comparable with each other:
`porch-tls-v7` grades a handshake, `porch-web-v3` grades an HTTP response,
`porch-mail-v1` grades what a domain's DNS says about its mail, and
`porch-dns-v1` grades how the domain itself is served — its name servers and
its DNSSEC chain. `-version` prints them all, and every report names the one
that produced it.

```sh
./porch-scan -check web -limits          # what a header check cannot establish
```

## The service

```sh
./porchd -listen 127.0.0.1:8080
```

Loopback by default, so an accidental start is not immediately public.
`porchd -h` lists every limit and its default.

The service takes `-resolver` too, for the lookups it makes itself — CAA, the
mail records and the proof-of-control challenge — and for the same reason as
above. It has to be an address and a port, not a name:

```sh
./porchd -listen 127.0.0.1:8080 -resolver 192.168.1.1:53
```

The addresses a scan connects to are still resolved by the machine.

Where the mail check asks each exchanger on port 25, it introduces itself with
EHLO. Unless told otherwise that name is this machine's fully qualified host
name or, failing that, its address — behind NAT, a private one — and the
exchanger's operator reads it. `-helo` sets it instead, on the service as on
the command line, and a name that could not be sent stops the service at start
rather than being quietly replaced by the machine's own:

```sh
./porchd -listen 127.0.0.1:8080 -helo scanner.example.com
```

Some providers refuse an EHLO that names no real host. A name that resolves to
the address the scan leaves from is the one least likely to be turned away.

## In a container

The image has **no base system**: no package manager, no shell, no libc.
There is nothing in it to update and nothing in it to take. It also builds
nothing — a builder stage would produce bytes nobody has checked, and the
argument of this project is that the release is signed and reproducible. So
the image is a wrapper around a binary **you verified**, or built yourself.

### On a server, step by step

1. Get the code and a binary. Either the release, verified — `docs/verify.md` —
   or built from this checkout on any machine with Go, which fetches nothing
   else:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/denyfirst/porch
   cd porch
   CGO_ENABLED=0 GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 go build -trimpath -o porchd ./cmd/porchd
   ```

   Built elsewhere, copy `porchd` into the checkout on the server.

2. Make the data directory and give it to the user the container runs as.
   There is no shell in the image to do this from inside:

   ```sh
   mkdir -p porch-data && sudo chown 65534:65534 porch-data
   ```

3. Start it:

   ```sh
   docker compose up -d --build
   docker compose logs
   ```

   The first start writes a verification secret to `porch-data/secret` and
   says so. Keep that file: it is what every domain's record is derived from,
   and a new one means every domain publishing its record again.

   It also prints this installation's password, once, in the log. The program
   writes it nowhere else, but Docker keeps the log until the container is
   recreated, which is one reason to change the password straight away.

4. Open it. The example publishes the service on the server's own loopback,
   so nothing is reachable from outside. From your computer:

   ```sh
   ssh -L 8080:127.0.0.1:8080 you@your-server
   ```

   and open `http://localhost:8080`.

5. Sign in with the password from the log, then change it under **This
   installation**. Everything the installation serves, pages and API alike,
   is behind it.

6. Check a name. The first time, the page shows a TXT record to add at your
   DNS provider — `_porch-challenge.<domain>` and its value — and a button to
   check again once it is published. After that the checks run, and they run
   for every name under that domain without asking again, for as long as the
   record is there. Delete the record and the domain is refused again.

### Proof of control is on, and has to be

A container listens beyond loopback by construction, and `porchd` refuses to
do that while scanning whatever it is given: it will not start without
`-verification-secret-file` or an explicit `-open`. The image and the compose
file both turn proof on. `-open` exists for a network nobody else can reach,
and it is the setting to think about twice. A password is the same: beyond loopback
`porchd` wants `-access-file`, or `-without-password` said out loud, and the
image and the compose file give it the first.

**Why showing the record is safe.** The value is derived from this
installation's secret and the one domain. It proves something only once it is
published in that domain's DNS, which only whoever runs the domain can do.
Copied to another domain it is the wrong value, because that domain's value is
different; copied into another installation it is the wrong value, because
that installation's secret is different. Somebody who sees your record in
public DNS learns nothing that lets them scan anything with your installation
or theirs.

**What it does not prove** is who owns the addresses a name points at. Whoever
runs a zone can point a name at anything. That is DNS, not this record, and it
is bounded by the rest of this page: private and reserved addresses are
refused, each host has a budget, and a scan sends what a browser or a mail
server would.

**It is asked every time.** Nothing remembers that a domain was proven: every
check asks DNS again, so taking the record out ends the proof. How soon
depends on the resolver, which may answer from its cache until the record's
time to live runs out; a short TTL on the record makes removal quick. A lookup
that fails is not taken as proof, and the check is refused with a sentence
saying the record could not be looked up.

**Starting over.** Every record is derived from the secret in
`porch-data/secret`. Delete it and restart, and a new one is made: every
record published so far stops proving anything, and each domain has to publish
its new value, which Domains shows.

**Signed or not.** Domains says whether the resolver reported the record
DNSSEC-signed. That is the resolver's word, not porch's own check, and it is
worth what the resolver is worth: from a validating resolver on this machine, a
great deal; from one across the internet over plain DNS, no more than the
record itself, because whoever could forge one could forge the other. With a
resolver you trust, `-verification-requires-dnssec` accepts only signed
records, and no challenge file. A domain whose zone is not signed can then
not be proven at all.

### One password, and what it seals

The compose file starts the service with `-access-file /data/access`, and
nothing it serves is reachable without signing in: not the pages, not the API,
not the history. There is one password, for whoever runs the installation.

**The password is never written down.** `porch-data/access` holds a random key,
sealed with AES-256-GCM under a key derived from the password with
PBKDF2-SHA256 at 600,000 iterations. Opening the seal is the password check.
What the installation keeps is encrypted under that key, so a copy of the disk,
or of a backup, holds nothing readable without the password.

**Every check is kept, and can be deleted.** Behind the password each report is
kept whole in `porch-data/history`, one file per report under a random name,
sealed with that key. A report is kept as it was drawn, so it carries the
name checked and the time it was measured; the list shows only the date.
**History** lists them, opens any of them as it was drawn, and deletes one for good. At most a thousand that
the password opens are kept, the oldest dropped first. A file in the history it
does not open — kept under an earlier password, or damaged — is never dropped
by that bound; History says how many there are and how much space they take.

**The domains you add are kept too**, in `porch-data/domains.sealed`, sealed the
same way: the names and the date each was added. Whether each is proven is not
kept. **Domains** asks DNS again every time it opens, so a record taken out of a
zone reads as unproven straight away.

**So a lost password cannot be recovered**, by anyone. Move
`porch-data/access` aside — to `porch-data/access.lost`, say — and restart: a
new password is printed and a new key made. Before it is made, the history and
the domain list kept under the old key are moved, not deleted, to
`porch-data/retired-<date>/`, and the log says where. The new password starts
with an empty history and an empty list of domains. What was moved opens only
with the old access file and its password: if the password comes back to you,
stop the service, put `access.lost` back as `access` and the contents of the
retired folder back in `porch-data`, and start it again. Otherwise delete the
folder once you are sure nobody needs it; porchd never does.

**A session is a cookie** that no script can read and no other site can send,
and it ends when you sign out, after twelve hours, or when the service
restarts. Changing the password ends every other session. Guessing is slowed
per address and one guess is checked at a time. A password is taken only over HTTPS
or through the SSH tunnel to `localhost`; sent in plain HTTP to any other
address it is refused before it is read.

### A public address, with a certificate

`porchd` reads a certificate from disk and reloads it when it is renewed. With
one from Let's Encrypt for `scan.example.com`:

```yaml
    command:
      - "-listen"
      - "0.0.0.0:8443"
      - "-verification-secret-file"
      - "/data/secret"
      - "-access-file"
      - "/data/access"
      - "-tls-cert"
      - "/certs/live/scan.example.com/fullchain.pem"
      - "-tls-key"
      - "/certs/live/scan.example.com/privkey.pem"
    ports:
      - "443:8443"
    volumes:
      - /etc/ssl/certs:/etc/ssl/certs:ro
      - ./porch-data:/data
      - /etc/letsencrypt:/certs:ro
```

A `command` replaces the one in the compose file, it is not added to it, so
every argument has to be there: drop `-access-file` and the password goes, and
`porchd` then refuses to start on a public address, because it will not serve
anyone beyond loopback without a password unless told `-without-password`.

The key has to be readable by user 65534. Nothing listens on port 80 — see
`docs/invariants.md`, P5 — so obtain the certificate with a DNS challenge, or
with `certbot certonly --standalone` while this service is stopped.

### The trust store comes from your machine

`docker-compose.yml` mounts `/etc/ssl/certs` read-only into the container and
points `SSL_CERT_DIR` at it.

This is not a convenience. Every verdict about a certificate chain is a
verdict *against some trust store*, and a report should reflect yours rather
than one baked in by whoever built an image. The standing limits already say
that a scan consults one trust store; this is where you choose which.

**An empty store does not fail — it reports every certificate as untrusted.**
The chains still verify, they verify to nothing, and every report says the
scanned server does not reach a trusted root: a finding about your container
printed as a finding about somebody else's server. So the service
refuses to start when it cannot find a store, rather than producing
confident nonsense.

### What the compose file takes away

`read_only: true`, `no-new-privileges:true`, `cap_drop: ALL`, and an
unprivileged user. The container binds a port above 1024 and the host
publishes it, so nothing inside needs the capability to bind a privileged port.
The data directory is the only writable path.

## What is yours now

The scan leaves your machine and your address is in the logs of whatever you
point it at. That is the arrangement working as intended, and it is also a
responsibility that used to be ours.

Scan what you own, what you administer, or what you have permission to scan.
This tool sends nothing but a standard client hello at each TLS version and
closes the connection when the handshake finishes — no exploit, no malformed
packet, no HTTP request — but a scan is still a connection somebody else pays
for, and thirteen to fifty of them is still thirteen to fifty.

The licence is AGPL-3.0. Run a modified version and offer it to others, and
the modifications have to be available to them. That is the point of the
licence for a tool whose value rests on being checkable.
