# Verifying a release

Two questions are worth asking about a binary you are about to run, and they
are different questions.

**Did this come from the maintainer?** Answered by the signature.

**Does it correspond to the source you can read?** Answered by rebuilding it,
or by trusting the workflow in this repository that rebuilds every release on
a machine the maintainer does not control.

Neither question is answered by downloading over HTTPS. TLS tells you the file
came from GitHub, and GitHub is not the party you need to trust.

---

## Check the signature

Every release carries `SHA256SUMS`, listing the SHA-256 of each binary, and
`SHA256SUMS.sig`, an OpenSSH signature over that list. Only the list is
signed: one verification then covers every file, and the list itself is the
record of what was released.

`ssh-keygen` ships with OpenSSH, so nothing needs installing.

```sh
# The public key that signs releases, from this repository.
curl -fsSLO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/denyfirst/porch/main/.allowed_signers

# The list and its signature, from the release.
curl -fsSLO https://github.com/denyfirst/porch/releases/download/v0.1.0/SHA256SUMS
curl -fsSLO https://github.com/denyfirst/porch/releases/download/v0.1.0/SHA256SUMS.sig

ssh-keygen -Y verify \
  -f .allowed_signers \
  -I releases@denyfirst.dev \
  -n file \
  -s SHA256SUMS.sig \
  < SHA256SUMS
```

A pass prints:

```
Good "file" signature for releases@denyfirst.dev with ED25519 key SHA256:ut6bginhZ4lZINMSXNDv3vJ6fyvmDHhtnoBJH0/Nr9Y
```

Anything else means stop. A missing signature, a key that does not match, or a
modified list are all the same answer.

### About the key

The signing key is not the key used to push to GitHub. They are separate so
that losing one does not cost the other, and so that compromising the GitHub
account does not yield the ability to sign a release.

That separation is the reason this signature is worth checking. If the key
lived in GitHub's secrets, anyone who took the account could sign whatever
they liked, and the signature would confirm only that the attacker had access.

## Check the binary against the list

```sh
curl -fsSLO https://github.com/denyfirst/porch/releases/download/v0.1.0/porch-scan_v0.1.0_linux_amd64

sha256sum --ignore-missing -c SHA256SUMS
```

On macOS, `shasum -a 256 --ignore-missing -c SHA256SUMS`.

From v0.25.1 the list also names `Dockerfile`, `Dockerfile.dockerignore` and
`docker-compose.yml`, the three files that run the service in a container, so
that a server needs nothing but the release. The same command checks them: every file it prints must say `OK`,
and a file it does not print was not downloaded.

On Windows:

```powershell
(Get-FileHash -Algorithm SHA256 .\porch-scan_v0.1.0_windows_amd64.exe).Hash.ToLower()
```

and compare that line against `SHA256SUMS` by eye.

---

## Rebuild it yourself

The signature says the maintainer produced the file. Rebuilding says the file
is what the source produces, which is the question that matters if you are
worried about the maintainer's account rather than about a download being
tampered with in transit.

Builds are reproducible. `-trimpath` removes local paths, `CGO_ENABLED=0`
removes the host C toolchain, and `-buildvcs=false` keeps the embedded version
stamp from varying with how the tree was fetched.

**Run the release's own build script rather than a command copied off this
page.** The flags are part of what the hash covers, and a second copy of them
in a document is free to drift away from the one that made the release. This
page carried such a copy until 2026-08-20, and it had drifted: it named
`-X main.version=v0.1.0` at a time when this program defined no such symbol.
Go accepts the flag silently, folds the whole link command into the build ID,
and writes that into the binary — so the recipe printed here produced a
different hash from the release, on the correct source, with the correct
compiler, for everyone who followed it. A verification step that fails for
honest reasons does not fail safe. It teaches the reader that mismatches here
are normal, which is the one lesson that must never be taught about this check.

The symbol exists now, and the script sets it, which does not make the old
recipe right — it makes the point sharper. The flags are whatever
`scripts/build.sh` says they are on the day of the release, and no document
can promise to keep up. Pass the tag exactly as it is written on the release:
the version is linked into the binary, so building `v0.2.0` as `v0.2.0.1` or
as `0.2.0` produces different bytes, correctly.

There is now one copy of the build command, in `scripts/build.sh`, used by the
release workflow, by the reproduction workflow, by the signing script and by
the instructions below. CI fails if a second one appears.

**v0.1.0 is the exception, and the only release so far.** It was cut before the
script existed and before `BUILD` recorded which script ran, so neither of the
two checks below has anything to compare against. Read *If the tag predates the
build record* before following these steps against it.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/denyfirst/porch
cd porch
git checkout v0.1.0

# BUILD, from the release, records what produced it: the Go version and the
# SHA-256 of the build script that ran. A different compiler produces
# different bytes from identical source, and so does a different script.
# Check both before concluding anything from a mismatch.
cat /path/to/downloaded/BUILD

go version                      # must match the toolchain line
sha256sum scripts/build.sh      # must match the buildscript line

# Through bash rather than as a program: the file is committed without an
# execute bit and the workflow sets one at build time.
# Builds every artifact in the release, which is what the workflow does.
bash scripts/build.sh v0.1.0 dist

sha256sum dist/porch-scan_v0.1.0_linux_amd64
```

The hash should match the line in `SHA256SUMS`. If it does not, and both the
toolchain and the script hash match, that is worth reporting through the
process in `SECURITY.md`.

On Windows, use the bash that ships with Git for Windows. Note that its
installer puts `cmd\` on PATH and not `bin\`, so `bash` is usually not on PATH
even when it is installed; it is at `C:\Program Files\Git\bin\bash.exe`. Do
not translate the script into PowerShell — a translation is a second copy of
the command, which is the thing that just went wrong.

### If the tag predates the build record

v0.1.0 was cut before `scripts/build.sh` existed and before `BUILD` carried a
`buildscript` line. Both gaps are real, neither can be fixed after the fact,
and the second is the one that matters: without it there is no record of what
procedure produced those binaries.

`reproduce.yml` refuses rather than guessing. Dispatched against v0.1.0 on
2026-08-20 — the first time it had ever been run — it fell back to the default
branch's script, found nothing in `BUILD` to check that script against, and
stopped:

```
the tag predates scripts/build.sh; falling back to the default branch
buildscript d004b43de04d4220f4d5608d6273786b47f121688e28cc63b7341cb08b8e880b
error: The BUILD record names no build script, so this reproduction cannot say
which procedure produced the release. Releases from before that field existed
have to be checked by hand.
```

That is the workflow working, not failing. A reproduction that cannot say which
procedure it reproduced proves nothing, and reporting a match on that basis
would be worse than reporting nothing at all.

What remains for v0.1.0 is a hand check with its limit stated:

```sh
cat /path/to/downloaded/BUILD   # match the toolchain line
go version

git fetch origin main
git checkout origin/main -- scripts/build.sh
bash scripts/build.sh v0.1.0 dist
sha256sum dist/porch-scan_v0.1.0_linux_amd64
```

A match means the source and today's procedure produce that binary, which is
worth something. A mismatch means nothing either way: the procedure that built
v0.1.0 was never recorded, so a difference is as likely to be a flag that
changed since as a binary that was tampered with. That is the whole reason the
`buildscript` field exists, and the reason it cannot help here.

Every tag from here on carries its own script and its own `buildscript` line,
and for those the reproduction is decisive.

`BUILD` is itself listed inside `SHA256SUMS`, so the signature checked above
covers it. That ordering is deliberate. While the provenance record sat outside
the signed list, anyone able to replace a release asset could also write the
explanation for why it no longer matched.

The `Reproduce` workflow in this repository does this automatically after every
release, on a GitHub runner. Its result is public, so the check exists whether
or not anyone runs it by hand.

## Ask a binary what it is

```sh
./porch-scan -version
```

```
porch-scan v0.20.0
policy porch-tls-v7
policy porch-web-v3
policy porch-mail-v3
policy porch-dns-v2
scans whatever it is pointed at, from this machine
```

The release and the rule sets are whatever the binary in front of you was built
with; the shape is the part to check.

Three kinds of line, because they answer three questions. The first is the
release, linked in at build time from the tag; each `policy` line is the rule
set one check grades by, and a verdict from one policy version is not
comparable with a verdict from another, so a report carries its own too. The
last says which hosts the binary will connect to at all.

A binary that prints `(unknown: not built by scripts/build.sh)` was built some
other way — most likely by `go build` from a checkout, which is a perfectly
good thing to be, and is not a release.

`porchd -version` answers the same way.

The version is linked into the binary rather than read from the filename, so
it is covered by the hash in `SHA256SUMS`. Renaming the file does not change
what it says about itself.

---

## Build from source and skip releases entirely

The most direct option, and the one that needs the least trust.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/denyfirst/porch
cd porch
go build ./cmd/porch-scan
```

There are no third-party dependencies. `go.mod` has no `require` block, so
`go build` fetches nothing beyond the standard library, and there is no
supply chain here to audit beyond Go itself.

---

## What none of this covers

Verification confirms the file matches the source. It does not confirm the
source is correct: a signed, reproducible build of subtly wrong grading rules
is still wrong. The rules are in `internal/policy`, each with the document it
rests on, and `docs/invariants.md` states what the project guarantees and
which test protects each guarantee. Those are the parts worth reading if you
intend to rely on the output.
