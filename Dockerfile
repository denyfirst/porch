# The image for whoever builds their own.
#
# The release's image is not built from this file. internal/ociimage builds it
# from the release's binaries so that it comes out byte for byte the same on
# any machine, and the release's docker-compose.yml names it by that digest
# (docs/invariants.md, S17). This builds the same contents from binaries you
# built yourself: its digest will not be the release's, because a Docker build
# stamps times, so name it in the compose file in place of the ghcr.io line,
# with pull_policy: never. TestTheImageStartsWhatTheDockerfileStarts keeps the
# two starting the same thing.
#
# It contains the two binaries, and nothing else: the service, and the command
# line that runs beside it with the service's secret (see the scan service in
# docker-compose.yml).
#
# It has no base system. A container built on alpine or debian carries several
# hundred packages this project does not audit and cannot reproduce, which
# would put a supply chain underneath a program that deliberately has none:
# go.mod has no require block, and this image has no package manager, no
# shell, and no libc. There is nothing in it to update, and nothing in it to
# take.
#
# It does not build anything either. A builder stage would produce bytes
# nobody has checked, and the whole argument of this project is that the
# release is signed and reproducible. So the binaries are ones you built or
# verified yourself — see docs/verify.md — and the image is a wrapper around
# bytes you have already decided to trust. Built from this checkout, which
# fetches nothing but Go:
#
#   CGO_ENABLED=0 GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 go build -trimpath -o porchd ./cmd/porchd
#   CGO_ENABLED=0 GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 go build -trimpath -o porch-scan ./cmd/porch-scan
#
# Each binary is built with CGO_ENABLED=0, so it needs no dynamic loader and no
# libc, which is what makes an empty image possible at all.

# Proof of control on by default. porchd refuses to scan anything for anyone
# beyond loopback without it, and inside a container every address is beyond
# loopback. The secret is created in /data on the first start, so /data has to
# be a writable volume owned by 65534 — see docker-compose.yml.
#
# And a password in front of it, for the same reason: porchd refuses to serve
# anyone beyond loopback without one. It is printed once in the log on the
# first start, and only a sealed key is written to /data.
